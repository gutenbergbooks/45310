</div>

<p>To search for the knowledge of our duty, as subjects
of the Divine Government, is of the highest importance
to Christians and to all men. "None of us
liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself," but
"whether we live or die, we are the Lord's." It behooves
us, therefore, to inquire, diligently and prayerfully,
what God would have us to do, and how we
may best glorify Him and save our generation? We
should "seek wisdom as silver, and search for it as for
hid treasure;" and we should labor after the knowledge,
not only of <i>some</i> duties, but of <i>every</i> duty.
"Obey my voice," is the reiterated mandate of Jehovah.
To give full proof of our friendship for Christ,
we must "do whatsoever he hath commanded us."
Hence the importance of "searching the Scriptures,"
and of carefully pondering the testimonies of God.
All should pursue this course, and feel this responsibility;
for "every one of us shall give account of
himself unto God." Hence the propriety and necessity,
<span class="pagenum">{1-4}</span>
in many cases, of <i>individuals</i> dissenting from the
views and decisions of <i>collective bodies</i>, and of <i>minorities</i>
dissenting from <i>majorities</i>, and protesting against
what they discover to be erroneous, unequal, and oppressive,
in their resolves and measures&mdash;accompanying
the same with a particular statement of their reasons.
Such a course expresses a determination "not
to be partakers of other men's sins," and is often the
means of leading to investigation and reform.</p>

<p>This duty is acknowledged, and this privilege is
claimed, by the observers of the <i>seventh day</i>, in relation
to the subject of the Sabbath. Compared with
the many who assume the Christian name, we are a
<i>minority</i>&mdash;a <i>mere remnant</i>&mdash;and our reasons and motives
for dissent from the great mass of believers, have
been by most but partially, if at all, examined and
weighed. Believing, as we do, that we have a full
and explicit Divine warrant for our practice, we regard
it as our duty to make renewed efforts to sustain
the claims of the original Sabbath of God's appointment,
enlighten the public mind, disarm our neighbors
and fellow Christians of their prejudices, and promote
a more thorough and impartial attention to this item of
religious practice. The object of this Tract is not to
enter fully upon the proofs of our doctrine and practice,
but to invite attention to the subject, and impress
the reader with the importance of correct views and
of being sustained in Sabbath principles and efforts
by an explicit warrant from God himself, in order the
more effectually to secure the sanctification of this
precious institution. Accordingly, we proceed to
state some of our Reasons for introducing the Sabbath
of the Fourth Commandment to the consideration of
the Christian Public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{1-5}</span>
I. The general concession that the weekly Sabbath
is a needful, wise, and valuable institution. Being a
weekly rest from secular business and labor, it contributes
to the health and vigor both of man and beast,
encourages habits of cleanliness and decency, gives
opportunity to cultivate the social virtues, makes man
acquainted with man, and inspires a mutual regard for
the interests of society; and, what is much more, it
furnishes a proper and necessary season for mental
improvement, public worship and instruction, private
meditation and self-examination, the training up of
children in the knowledge of God and of Heaven, and
the deepening of our impressions of the value of time,
and of the importance of preparing for eternity. These
and similar considerations sensibly arrest the attention
of sober and enlightened Christians, and secure a conscientious
regard to the institution. This fact evinces
the importance of being able to bring a <i>divine sanction</i>
for a day so evidently desirable, and so generally
esteemed&mdash;of being assured that it rests upon no doubtful
authority, that it is not a mere human provision or
a matter of expediency and accommodation, but that
in observing it we are conforming to the clearly-manifested
will of God. It is evident, that this consideration
will give a value to the institution which can be
supplied by no other, and secure a love and respect
for it, and a delight in it, which nothing else can so
effectually produce. Hence the question is presented,
with a high and impressive claim to a true and definite
answer, Is any other than the <i>seventh</i> day of the
week sustained by the important and indisputable sanction
of <i>divine authority</i>? If this, and this only, be the
Sabbath of God's appointment, for general and permanent
use, then, by the substitution of another day,
the institution is shorn of its chief excellence and force&mdash;yea,
it is virtually annulled. It no longer exists as
<span class="pagenum">{1-6}</span>
God ordained it, for the express reason that he gave
for it. This is a point which it becomes Christians
seriously to look at.</p>

<p>II. It is not the province of Rulers, Bishops, or
Councils, to legislate for the Church, and to bind the
consciences of men in this or any other matter.
Man's appointment of another day than the one contained
in the Divine Enactment, does not make it <i>the
Sabbath of the Lord</i>. It is only a <i>human law</i>, resting
on <i>human authority</i>. Therefore, all attempts to
enforce the observance of such an institution as being
of divine authority, are calculated to mislead and ensnare
souls. It is "teaching for doctrine the commandments
of men." Our faith in this matter "should
not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of
God." The question is not, What day have men
judged most proper? and, What reasons for the institution
have they deemed the most appropriate? and,
What day have civil rulers sanctioned by their decrees
and penalties?&mdash;but it is, What day has God sanctified
and blessed as a day of rest? It is manifest that no
man should stop his inquiries until he is able to produce
a clear divine warrant for his practice.</p>

<p>III. The fact that there is a lamentable division
among professors of religion in regard to the true design
of the weekly Sabbath, and the proper day to be
observed, evinces the great importance of investigation,
and of arriving at a correct knowledge of the
Divine Will. This division is not likely to cease till
a more general and thorough knowledge of the subject
is obtained, and a deeper interest therein is felt. Can
it reasonably be supposed that the whole church will
become united in the observance of the <i>first</i> day of
the week, if it is not the Sabbath of the Bible? Will
<span class="pagenum">{1-7}</span>
it ever be the case, that God will have no witnesses
for his own unrepealed and unadulterated institution?&mdash;none
that shall call the Sabbath of his own appointment
"a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and
shall honor him therein?" No&mdash;this will never
be! Admitting that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment
is still binding, there is no doubt that there
will ever be a remnant, at least, who will conscientiously
observe it. For his great name's sake, God
will not suffer this prominent part of his law to be universally
corrupted and profaned. And hence, if a
preference continues to be given, as it is now, to a day
which He has not designated and made holy, there
will, of necessity, be a protracted division in the ranks
of Zion, and the cause of the Redeemer will, on this
account, continue to suffer. The faithful witnesses
will unquestionably continue to prophecy, though
clothed in sackcloth, and to bear testimony against
the innovation. And no earthly power can prevent
them. Resolves, and proscriptions, and gibbets, will
not wholly suppress their testimony in favor of the
Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Therefore, the
occasion of the present division must be put away by
a general return to the uncorrupted appointment of
God, or the same cause for regret and mourning which
now exists will continue to afflict the church. Let
those who regard the unity and peace of Zion, seriously
lay to heart this consequence.</p>

<p>IV. It must be admitted, that in so important a matter
as a weekly Sabbath, our great moral Legislator
has sufficiently declared his will to enable honest and
impartial inquirers to arrive at a true result. If it
would be reasonable to expect explicit information of
his will concerning any point, it would certainly be
reasonable to expect it concerning this, seeing the
<span class="pagenum">{1-8}</span>
claims of this law would come in direct contact with
the cupidity of men, and sensibly influence the arrangements
of business and pleasure&mdash;yea, deeply affect the
general interests of society. Were the data furnished,
from which contemplative and well-disposed minds
might <i>infer</i> a weekly Sabbath, its observance and its
ends could not be extensively secured without an <i>explicit</i>
warrant. Therefore, if God intended there
should be a Sabbath&mdash;yea, we might with propriety
say, that if he intended his religion and worship should
be preserved in the world&mdash;he would have given an
explicit law upon this subject&mdash;one, of course, which
could be easily discovered, and the permanent obligation
of which could be readily traced.</p>

<p>V. It is an obvious <i>fact</i>, that God <i>has legislated</i>
upon this subject&mdash;that he has once made a law for
the observance of the <i>seventh day</i> as a <i>weekly Sabbath</i>.
He did this at the close of his creative operations.
Excepting marriage, the seventh-day Sabbath
is the oldest institution in the world. Moreover, God
gave a new edition of this law at the promulgation of
the Decalogue upon Mount Sinai, under circumstances
of peculiar and awful solemnity and majesty; first
pronouncing it, in connection with the other nine commandments,
with an audible voice from the Mount, in
the hearing of all Israel, amidst thunders, and flames,
and tempests; and afterwards writing the <i>entire ten</i> on
two tables of stone, for a perpetual rule of action. It
is obvious, also, that <i>obedience</i> to this institution, so
solemnly stated and defined, and enforced by so plain
and adequate a reason, was regarded as a prominent
item of duty, and received his <i>marked approbation</i>,
whereas <i>disobedience</i> received his <i>marked disapprobation</i>.
It is also clear, that good men throughout the
times of the Old Testament were peculiarly zealous
<span class="pagenum">{1-9}</span>
for this institution, and sought diligently to prevent its
neglect or desecration, and to secure its legitimate advantages.
Thus far all is plain, and is generally conceded.</p>

<p>VI. It is a principle which no proficient in the science
of Government, <i>divine</i> or <i>human</i>, will deny, that
a law, once enacted and in force, remains in force, unless
repealed or amended by the same authority which
first enacted it. Hence, if the law respecting the seventh-day
weekly Sabbath has not been repealed or
amended by the same authority which first enacted it,
it still remains in full force and obligation, as originally
given. This conclusion is <i>legitimate</i>, <i>necessary</i>, and
<i>undeniable</i>. It is obvious to persons of every capacity.
And we here declare our deliberate and settled conviction,
from a careful and thorough examination of
the matter, that there has never been any such repeal
or amendment; hence, that our obligation, and that of
all men, to keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment,
remains without the least abatement. "Till
heaven and earth pass," we believe, according to the
declaration of the Saviour, "one jot or one tittle shall
in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." We
alledge, then, fearless of successful contradiction, that
it <i>never has been so repealed or amended</i>, and hence <i>is
now binding</i> upon the entire family of man.</p>

<p>VII. From the nature of the case, and from God's
declared will, and procedure in other cases on scriptural
record, it is evident that the same divine authority
is attached to <i>the day</i> of the week to be observed,
as belongs to the <i>institution itself</i>, so that there is no
room to say, that if a <i>seventh pert</i> of time is observed
as a holy rest, it is not essential which day of the week
is selected. When God appointed the Passover to be
<span class="pagenum">{1-10}</span>
kept on the fourteenth day of the first month at even,
the time of keeping it could not be changed to the
thirteenth or fifteenth of the month, without disregarding
his authority. There was, indeed, a specified case
in which those who were not in the prescribed circumstances
to keep the fast at the time appointed, might
celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month
at even. But without this express divine provision, no
departure from the first arrangement would have been
allowable. And when God commanded Saul to slay
the Amalekites, without exception, together with the
sheep and the cattle, it did not answer for him to spare
their king, and "the best of the sheep and the oxen
for sacrifice." For this deviation from the course prescribed,
God pronounced him a transgressor, and visited
him in judgment, declaring that "to obey is better
than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
So when God instituted a weekly Sabbath, and specified
the seventh day for that purpose, assigning a special
and appropriate reason, it was manifestly his will
that that particular day should be observed; and the
substitution of another day, without subsequent instruction
to that effect, cannot be reconciled with a due
regard for his supreme authority. It is "changing
the ordinance, and breaking the everlasting covenant."</p>

<p>VIII. It is evident that the substitution of the <i>first</i> day
of the week for the <i>seventh</i>, as a weekly Sabbath,
which has been adopted by the major part of the professors
of Christianity, has presented, and continues to
present, a formidable obstacle to the conversion of the
Jews, and the introduction of the millennium. It is
well known, that the Jews as a body are exceedingly
tenacious of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment;
that, with few exceptions, they have persevered from
ancient times in its observance; and that they consider
<span class="pagenum">{1-11}</span>
it a prominent article in the religion of their forefathers.
This practice has been unbroken in the nation
from the time of the giving of the law upon Mount
Sinai till the present day. There have been, indeed,
many instances of Sabbath-breaking among them, and
at present there is reason to believe that the motives
which govern them in its observance are sadly deficient.
But the <i>practice itself</i> is tenaciously adhered
to, as required by the unrepealed law of the God of
Israel. And, if our views are correct, they have the
right of the case, and the majority of Christians have
corrupted the law. This, therefore, is a formidable
obstacle to their embracing Christianity. To become
<i>first-day</i> Christians (and such compose a vast majority
of professors) they must relinquish or change one of
the precepts of the Decalogue, and dissent from a
custom held sacred by their ancestors, and deeply
venerated by themselves; and that, too, without
seeing any <i>divine warrant</i> produced for such a
departure. This unauthorized practice of keeping
the first instead of the seventh day of the week, cannot
fail to prove a powerful objection in their view to
embracing the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is true that
they are tenacious also of other practices enjoined in
the Old Testament, which Christians justly regard as
obsolete. But as to <i>these</i>, we can show authority for
their <i>abrogation</i>. We can appeal to the New Testament
records, and show that the Mosaic <i>ritual</i>,
"the law of commandments contained in ordinances,"
which constituted the enmity or separation between
Jews and Gentiles, was abolished by the death of
Christ&mdash;that "he took it out of the way, nailing it to
his cross." But the same course cannot be successfully
pursued with respect to the seventh-day Sabbath.
The Decalogue in which this is found was not included
in the abrogated ritual. It is altogether a distinct
<span class="pagenum">{1-12}</span>
thing, wherefore the Jews cannot be met in the same
way with regard to the weekly Sabbath as they can
with regard to the typical observances which had their
accomplishment in Christ. Hence the stumbling-block
remains. And yet those who observe the first day are
generally praying for and expecting the conversion of
the Jews, and, in connection therewith, the millennial
glory of the church. What an inconsistency is this!
While they are praying for their national conversion
and return to the land of their forefathers, and are beginning
to use some other means for that end, they,
by their palpable violation of the law of the fourth
commandment, place a most formidable obstacle in
their way, and pursue a course calculated to augment
their prejudices, confirm their unbelief, and retard the
approach of millennial glory. To bring Jews and
Gentiles together in the observance of the Sabbath,
the one party or the other must materially change their
practice. And which is it most reasonable to expect
will ultimately be compelled to make the change&mdash;the
<i>Jews</i>, who have the authority of God's example and
express precept to sustain them, or the <i>Gentiles</i>, who
can claim no such authority for a first-day Sabbath?
Surely, we need not be at a loss for an answer. It is
confidently believed, that this subject has no inconsiderable
bearing upon the condition and prospects of the
Jews. If a few conversions are now effected among
them, what might be expected if Christians would remove
the stumbling-blocks which their own errors
have placed in their way? Would we enter an effectual
plea in behalf of this wonderful and long-neglected
people, we know not how we could do it better
than to plead for the observance of the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment. Let those whose "heart's desire
and prayer to God for Israel is," like Paul's, "that
they might be saved," give this subject a thorough and
<span class="pagenum">{1-13}</span>
impartial consideration, and return to the path of strict
obedience.</p>

<p>IX. It is not to be expected, that an effectual check
can be put to the sin of Sabbath-breaking, till the duty
of keeping the Sabbath is so taught, understood, and
practiced, that the sanction of express divine authority
can be brought to bear upon it. Though a weekly
rest be profitable, both as it respects "the life that now
is, and that which is to come," there is much in the
carnal views and inclinations of men to oppose it, to
resist its restrictions, and to thwart its purposes. Hence
powerful considerations and inducements are necessary
to suppress its desecration, and insure its proper observance.
Not only the <i>unbelieving world</i>, but <i>Christians</i>,
in their present imperfect state, need to have this
institution thoroughly guarded to prevent its abuse. If
it be considered as resting upon <i>doubtful authority</i>;
if it be viewed as sustained merely by <i>inference</i>, and
the <i>premises</i> from which the inference is drawn be at
best questionable, and do not <i>necessarily</i> authorize it;
if the principal argument for it be founded on a supposed
apostolic example of meeting for public worship
on the first day of the week, which is sustained only by
<i>two</i> passages, while those <i>very passages</i> fail to mark it
as <i>a Sabbath</i>, or to give the least intimation of its having
been introduced as <i>a substitute</i> for the former Sabbath,
and even fail to imply, necessarily, that meetings
of this description were <i>stated</i> and <i>general</i> in the
churches in the apostolic age; and if it be found, from
subsequent ecclesiastical history, that the first day, called
Sunday and Lord's day, was not regarded by Christians
in the first centuries after the apostles as <i>a Sabbath</i>,
nor as <i>substituted therefore</i>, but only as a <i>festival</i>
in commemoration of the resurrection&mdash;a <i>festival</i> observed
in connection with the Sabbath, but not accompanied
<span class="pagenum">{1-14}</span>
with a <i>resting from worldly labor</i>, till the time
of Constantine the Great; yea, if but a part of those
who are considered experimental Christians, look upon
it <i>now</i> as properly <i>a Sabbath</i>, or day of <i>holy rest</i>,
while others regard it merely as a day for <i>public worship</i>,
and even such as call it a Sabbath conceive, in
many instances, that the <i>strict</i> observance formerly
required is somewhat <i>modified</i>; we can easily perceive,
that it wants that <i>explicit sanction</i>&mdash;that <i>high</i>
and <i>overpowering authority</i>&mdash;which will be likely to
awe the public into obedience&mdash;which is necessary,
indeed, to give Christians themselves a proper sense
of its sanctity, and of the evil of its desecration&mdash;to
induce them "not to do their own ways, nor to find
their own pleasure, nor to speak their own words," in
it. In vain do its friends procure for it the resolutions
of churches and synods, the essays of the learned, and
the decrees of the State; if it fails of being expressly
supported by the supreme authority of God, to whom
all must render a final and strict account, it will
lack the main motive to obedience&mdash;it will be unattended
with that power which, above all others, acts
upon the conscience, and makes men feel their obligation.
And as such authority does not pertain
to a first-day Sabbath, but is limited to the seventh day,
it is manifest that no thorough check to Sabbath desecration
can be imposed, till men change their views
and practice, and place the institution on its original
and proper basis.</p>

<p>X. The power of custom, though sustained by
ecclesiastical and civil enactments, and with corresponding
forfeitures and penalties, ought not to prevent
investigation and discourage reform in this important
matter. When the claims of the original Sabbath
are plainly presented, many seem to be convinced
<span class="pagenum">{1-15}</span>
of their justness; but, at the same time, think that a
general return to the observance of the seventh day is
impracticable. They alledge that the custom of keeping
the first day has been so long and so generally
maintained&mdash;that it is so intimately wrought into the
habits, calculations, and business of life&mdash;that it has
received such explicit sanction from the civil powers,
obedience thereto being required by the authority of
the State, and the disobedient being subjected to civil
pains and penalties&mdash;and that it is so often, ably, and
pointedly vindicated by the first ministers, professors,
and commentators in the popular churches, that it is
in vain to expect a change, and that the cause of Sabbath-keeping
is rather retarded than promoted by
efforts to change the present custom. And it is highly
probable that some, in view of these difficulties, forbear
to give the subject a close investigation. But if
the same views and modes of reasoning had been
adopted in other cases, what would have become
of the various reformations which are now established,
and even triumphant? What would have
become of the whole subject of <i>Protestantism</i>? There
is nothing more impracticable in a Sabbath reform
than in any other reform. In other cases, difficulties
which at first seemed insurmountable, have given way
to laborious, prayerful, and united efforts. And there
is the same reason to believe that they will give way
in this, if a proper zeal is once awakened, and the
friends of the Sabbath are resolved to examine the subject,
build on the foundation of truth, and persevere
in their labors, with union and vigor, relying upon the
protecting power and blessing of Israel's God. It is
manifest that no earthly consideration should impede
our investigation of this matter, that no array of opposition
and discouragement should daunt us, and that
no motives to sit still or pass along with the current
<span class="pagenum">{1-16}</span>
of public opinion, if that be not founded in truth,
should be suffered to influence us, and detain us in the
wilderness of error. The cause of obedience is the
cause of God, and we should steadfastly labor to promote
it, and trust in him for ultimate victory.</p>

<p>XI. As a consequence of the foregoing principles
and facts, we are constrained to regard those who observe
the first day of the week, to the neglect of the
seventh day, as having sadly deviated from the path
of obedience, and we feel ourselves bound to admonish
them, and labor respectfully and kindly to reclaim
them. We cannot think it <i>immaterial</i> what day of the
week is observed as a day of rest, when God has
specified the seventh, and <i>no other</i>, as a weekly Sabbath.
We cannot think it a small matter to substitute
the first day in the room of the seventh, although it be
done in honor of the resurrection of our Lord, and
because that event appears to demand equal and even
greater commemoration than the work of creation, so
long as there is no divine warrant therefor. This appears
to us to be making the wisdom of man the
foundation of duty, and not the wisdom of God. We
discover <i>two</i> evils here; first, changing <i>the day</i> without
order or permission from God; and, secondly,
changing <i>the reason</i> for the institution, when the Lord
hath not spoken. And is not this a departure from
the rule of duty? And has not the Lord a controversy
with Zion for this? If God had seen fit to substitute
the first day for the seventh day, on account of
the resurrection, (supposing it to have occurred on the
first day, which, however, is not certain,) and to assign
another reason than the original one for keeping the
Sabbath, he would doubtless have given order to that
effect. His not having done so, makes it manifest that
he did not see fit to do this, and that he considered the
<span class="pagenum">{1-17}</span>
former Sabbath as well adapted to celebrate the
work of redemption as it was the work of creation&mdash;adapted
perfectly to subserve <i>all the purposes</i> of a
weekly Sabbath. And we find this to be the case by
experience. Here, therefore, we rest satisfied with
the divine arrangement, and feel deeply the importance
of universal conformity thereto. Consequently, our
regard for the honor of God, and for the sabbatic institution,
induces us to bring this subject in the present
form before the Christian public. We do not think
that we are justly chargeable with opposing or retarding
the practice of Sabbath-keeping, because we protest
against keeping the first day of the week as a
divine institution, and faithfully present the claims of
the original Sabbath. What better course can we
take to secure a proper observance of the Sabbath,
than to labor to restore it as God originally made it?
It is not just to charge us with <i>Judaizing</i>&mdash;with virtually
denying that Christ has come in the flesh and introduced
the New Testament dispensation. We might
as well be charged with this for maintaining that
men should not "have any other God before the
Lord," or that they should "not kill," nor "steal."
These precepts are in close connection with that requiring
the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath,
and <i>stand or fall with it</i>. The truth of the case is,
that the law containing the weekly Sabbath is the law
both of the Old Testament and of the New. There
is no Christian Sabbath distinct from the Sabbath of
the fourth commandment. If this be a correct view&mdash;and
we see not how it can be gainsayed&mdash;we in this
respect perform our duty as subjects of God's moral
government only when we exhort men to "remember
the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," and when we labor
to impress them with the annexed fact, that "the seventh
day is the Sabbath."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{1-18}</span>
These are some of our Reasons for introducing the
subject of the Sabbath, as originally given, to your
consideration. And we seriously ask you, whether
they are not <i>sufficient</i>&mdash;whether they are not <i>adequate</i>
for earnestly and perseveringly inviting investigation
and reformation. If there be any blame attached
to us in the matter, it is for not having labored
more diligently and efficiently in this cause. Are
we not dearly bound, by way of promoting inquiry
and reform, to bear a more pointed testimony against
the evil in question, and to vindicate the claims of
the seventh-day Sabbath with more zeal and firmness
than ever before? Are we not peculiarly obligated
to labor to remove, if possible, the veil which is
upon the minds of the great majority of professors of
Christianity, correct the false notions received by tradition
from 'the Fathers,' and effectually dispel the delusion
so extensively prevailing. We do not claim
the right of dictating to the consciences of others.
"To their own Master they stand or fall." The only
ground which we would assume is that which was
occupied by the Apostle Paul when he said, "It is
written, I have believed, and therefore have I spoken;
we also believe, and therefore speak." And also by
the Saviour, "Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
which is in Heaven." And again, "Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them; for this is the law and the prophets." Surely,
"the Lord hath spoken, and who can but prophesy?"
How can we bear to see one of his commandments
made void by human tradition?&mdash;to see the flock of
Jesus divided concerning this question, where union
is so necessary and desirable?&mdash;to witness the unavoidable
interruptions occasioned by the different parties,
and the triumph of the adversaries of religion?&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum">{1-19}</span>
observe those for whom Christ died grossly misled by
mistaken teachers, provoking the Most High by neglecting
to keep a day which he has made sacred, and
transferring the sacredness of his own appointment to
an ordinance of men, or, what is still worse, regarding
the original institution as annulled, and placing in
its stead a day merely of memorial of the resurrection
and of worship, divested of the main characteristics
of the Sabbath, and resting upon no solid basis&mdash;its
foundation, at best, being <i>mere probability</i> and <i>conjecture</i>?
Must it not, of necessity, be very painful to us,
to see those who are our neighbors, and by profession
our fellow Christians, in a case so clear and important,
and involving such high and permanent
interests, contented with such evidence as they would
blush to introduce in relation to almost any other
point? How can we bear to see <i>Protestants</i>, whose
avowed maxim is, that "scriptural authority alone
is sufficient to determine matters of faith and duty,"
dispensing with their own rule, in not requiring expressly
a "thus saith the Lord" for their practice,
and relying upon far-fetched and inconclusive reasonings,
and mere probabilities&mdash;yea, in some instances,
by their own concession, going out of the Bible to
ecclesiastical history, to find a warrant for observing
the first day of the week, which warrant itself, even
if proof from that source were allowable, is by no
means adequate?</p>

<p>Do we talk of reforming the church, while the guilt
of disobedience in this matter rests upon the great majority
of her members?&mdash;while ministers, doctors, and
professors of divinity, break one of the commandments
of the Decalogue, and teach men so, and the
multitude are willingly obedient to their instructions?
It is <i>preposterous</i>! A thorough reformation cannot
<span class="pagenum">{1-20}</span>
be effected under such circumstances, or while things
remain thus. It is time that it were more deeply
laid to heart, that one of the leading objects of Christ's
mission was to "save his people from their sins"&mdash;that
"he gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works"&mdash;and that "he that
saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
is a liar, and the truth is not in him?" In view of
such passages, although it be admitted that occasional
mistakes and sins, being repented of, do not absolutely
divest men of the Christian character and hopes, it
will appear, that obedience to the will of God is an indispensable
requisite and all-absorbing consideration;
and that, if any man be in Christ, he is verily "a new
creature"&mdash;that he will be "zealous of good works."
One in ancient times, who was eminent for his religious
knowledge, observed, "Then shall I not be
ashamed, when I have respect unto <i>all</i> thy commandments."
And this respect, or obedience, which
constitutes the moral purity and glory of Christians,
and is the test of their discipleship, must be regulated
and governed by the precepts of that very law
which contains the seventh-day Sabbath. There are,
indeed, some precepts peculiar to the gospel, such as
"repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord
Jesus Christ," "Baptism," and "the Lord's Supper."
Nevertheless, "the commandments of God," so often
and so particularly alluded to as the rule of Christian
duty, are eminently the precepts of the Decalogue&mdash;the
"<i>ten words</i>" or "<i>testimonies</i>" which God spake
with his own mouth, and wrote with his own finger,
and no one of which has ever been erased from the
sacred code, or undergone the least alteration; for
"the law of the Lord is <i>perfect</i>, converting the soul."
The keeping of the weekly Sabbath, therefore, as God
<span class="pagenum">{1-21}</span>
appointed it, and has continued it, enters vitally into the
matter of holy obedience&mdash;the true test of Christianity.
If the prescriptions of the fourth commandment are
not faithfully adhered to, our obedience is imperfect.
We are the proper subjects of reprehension, and may
reasonably expect corresponding tokens of Divine displeasure.
Sabbath-keeping is peculiarly adapted to
serve as a test of loyalty to God, on account of its frequent
occurrence, the weekly remission which it requires
of secular business, the peremptory call which
it makes on us to leave all our own works and ways
for the special service of God, and the opportunity
which it affords, amidst the common hurry and bustle
of this world, to pause and examine our state and
prospects for eternity. It is well calculated for this,
because it so clearly and so often teaches us that the
will of God should govern all our actions. All these
and similar considerations, therefore, should combine
to fix our attention to the very day of God's appointment,
so that we may sensibly feel that we are governed
by a divine warrant, and have the sublime pleasure
of knowing that we are conforming to the will of
God. Taking this course, we not only preserve a
good conscience, but tread in the footsteps of God's
redeemed flock. We imitate those who, in the times
of the Old Testament, "took pleasure in his holy
day." We follow the example of the Redeemer himself,
who was a strict observer of the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment. His vindication of the disciples
in the case of "plucking the ears of corn" to satisfy
their hunger, which some have thought was a deviation
from the strictness originally required, was in
perfect accordance with the true intent and meaning
of the law, else his obedience would have been imperfect,
and thereby the entire prospects of the Christian
would have been blasted. Under the circumstances,
<span class="pagenum">{1-22}</span>
it was a work of absolute necessity, and therefore
not prohibited. As our Lord Jesus Christ was unquestionably
a strict observer of the seventh-day Sabbath,
it is a commanding motive for a continued observance
of it by his followers, there being no substitute
appointed.</p>

<p>The Apostles, also, and primitive Christians, were
conscientious observers of this institution as originally
delivered. The Sabbath so often mentioned in the
apostolic records is unquestionably the seventh-day
Sabbath. Who will dare deny this? And from ecclesiastical
history it appears that the whole Christian
church, with very few exceptions at most, kept the
seventh-day Sabbath, in obedience to the law contained
in the Decalogue, down to the time of Constantine,
in the fourth century, and even afterward. So true
it is, that we imitate the church in her primitive and
purest times, in keeping the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment. Under such circumstances, therefore,
is it strange that we should strenuously advocate
the practice?&mdash;that we should adhere to it amidst
reproaches, privations, and suffering?&mdash;and that we
should feel the most ardent desire for the reformation
of our brethren who differ from us? The cause is
sufficient to demand this deep feeling, this unwearied
effort, these prayers and tears, with a vast increase of
holy sensibility, tenderness of conscience, and active
labor, to promote this branch of obedience. We therefore
earnestly, and with all due respect, commend the
subject to your notice. Do not pass it by as a matter
of little or no consequence. It surely involves much
that should be dear to the friends of Jesus, and the
advocates of pure morality&mdash;to such as would see the
church appear "fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
and terrible as an army with banners." We entreat
you, therefore, for the glory of God, the honor of his
<span class="pagenum">{1-23}</span>
law and government, the unity and perfection of the
church, your own spiritual attainments and acceptance
with God, the conversion and salvation of sinners, the
triumph of truth over infidelity, the redemption of the
long-neglected house of Israel, the hastening of millennial
prosperity, and the recompenses of eternity, to
give this subject a most serious consideration, to examine
and weigh our proofs and arguments, and, if
you find yourselves in error, as we confidently believe
you will, to reform. With the high consideration in
view, that "wisdom's ways are pleasantness, and all her
paths are peace," and that to pursue them "is for your
life," we invite and seek your recovery to sound views
and practice in this matter. We "long after you in
the bowels of Jesus Christ," regarding him as "the
Lord of the Sabbath," not to repeal or change the
sacred institution, but to protect it, and enforce obedience
thereto. Firmly believing that "we are not without
law to God, but under the law to Christ," we cannot
by any means discharge our own convictions at this
eventful period, this remarkable age of attempted reform,
without using all the persuasion in our power
to promote an investigation of this matter.</p>

<p>We behold with sincere gratification the efforts
which have been made, and are being made, in regard
to other subjects of special importance to the church
and the world. We would cordially coöperate with
their respective advocates in securing, as far as practicable,
a strict obedience to other moral precepts, and
in emancipating the human mind from sin and error.
But we cannot forget that God has given a <i>fourth</i>, as
well as a <i>first</i>, a <i>sixth</i>, a <i>seventh</i>, and a <i>tenth</i> commandment,
and that it rests upon equal authority with those,
and with either of the precepts of the Decalogue; and
hence we plead in its behalf. We do this as moral
<span class="pagenum">{1-24}</span>
and accountable beings, as Protestants, as Christians,
as reformers, and as cotemporaries of our brethren in
the nineteenth century, a period so distinguished for
its moral and political enterprises, and for its proximity
to the time when it shall be said, "The kingdoms of
this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and
of his Christ." We approach you in the belief that
"open rebuke is better than secret love"&mdash;that "faithful
are the wounds of a friend"&mdash;and that we "should
admonish one another daily, and so much the more as
we see the day approaching." We feel bound to exert
ourselves in this cause, in the belief that "our labor
will not be in vain in the Lord," that the church is
"coming up out of the wilderness," and that we live
in the dawn of a brighter day, in a period of the
world when the scriptures and the providences of God
concur in affording the highest encouragement to the
faithful advocates of truth and duty. And we do not
hesitate to express our expectation, that by the blessing
of God upon the well-directed and persevering
labors of his people, and the continued and augmenting
spirit of inquiry, there will soon be achieved a
glorious reformation in respect to the subject of this
Tract. God will "overturn, and overturn, and overturn,
till He shall come, whose right it is," and "the
sanctuary shall be cleansed."</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;we enter our testimony in what we deem
an important case, in the hope, through grace, of meeting
all "the faithful in Christ Jesus in the everlasting
rest," of which the rest of the seventh day is a lively
and touching type and foretaste.</p>

          class="small">ITS MORAL NATURE AND OBSERVANCE</span></h2>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.<br /><br />
    the sabbath not ceremonial.</span></h3>

<p>It is disputed whether the weekly Sabbath is an
essential part of what is generally called the Moral
Law, which the Holy Ghost declares to be "spiritual&mdash;holy,
and just, and good;" or whether it is to be
classed among the ceremonial institutions, which were
"a shadow of things to come." If the latter position
can be established, it can be of no use whatever to
perpetuate the Institution under the New Dispensation.
It can neither be promotive of the spirituality
and growth of the body of Christ, nor even conservative
of the morals of the community. To suppose
that the church cannot enjoy all necessary prosperity,
and attain its millennial glory by the use of New Covenant
ordinances alone, but must borrow a little help
from the abrogated rites of the Old Economy, is most
anti-evangelical. Gal. iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The church needs nothing
for the nourishment of its piety, except such
means as have the entire sanction of the "better covenant."
Moses is dead, and the Lord has buried
him. He cannot load us into the promised inheritance.
We have only to follow our Joshua, even
Jesus, "the Son who is consecrated forevermore."</p>

<p>Nor can "the weak and beggarly elements" be of
service to promote the morals of the community.
Where do we find the most elevated and pure morality,
<span class="pagenum">{2-2}</span>
that which is refined from all selfishness? We find
it only in real Christians. The source, and life, and
power of it is the Atonement of their Great High-Priest,
and the grace which is by Him. Their obedience
to all moral precepts is the obedience of <i>faith</i>,
even faith in his sacrifice. In proportion as their
faith is strong, and their dependence on Him entire,
to the exclusion of all reliance upon their own merit,
so is their moral conduct irreproachable. It is not by
any resort to the "weak and unprofitable commandment,"
that their morality acquires such excellence.
As for that inferior kind of morality, which obtains
among unbelievers, however profitable it may be to
human society, it is but the mimic representation of
that which is practiced by the godly. For its very
existence it is dependent on Christianity, from whose
influence if it recede, it becomes withered and perishes.
Transplanted to a heathen soil, it cannot live.
As, therefore, the general morals of the community
are traceable to the gospel as their first cause, and are
kept in credit only by its nurturing influence, it would
be at war with sound reason to suppose, that they
could be promoted by such things as are destructive
of the purity of the gospel itself. They will be much
safer, if left wholly to the nurturing influence of that
system, which is declared to be 'complete and faultless,&mdash;the
power and the wisdom of God.' Wherefore,
if the weekly Sabbath was a ceremonial Institution,
we have no use for it, either as it respects the
church, or the world. It is an injury rather than a
benefit.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, the Sabbath is a part of
God's holy, and just, and good law, to which nothing
but the carnal mind refuses subjection, Rom. viii.&nbsp;7,
it must be an institution of lasting value, to dispense
with which is dangerous in the extreme. For the
<span class="pagenum">{2-3}</span>
transgression of this law is sin, 1&nbsp;John iii.&nbsp;4, and the
wages of sin is death, Rom. vi.&nbsp;23.</p>

<p>That the Sabbath was not a ceremonial institution,
is proved from the fact that it was given to man before
his Apostacy, Gen. ii.&nbsp;1-3. There he had no need
of a Redeemer, for he bore the image of his Maker
in righteousness and true holiness. If man in his
original state of uprightness had no need of a Redeemer,
he certainly had no need of a type of the
Redeemer. Types, in such a case, were unmeaning
things, or else a source of vexation and horrible forebodings.
If he understood their meaning, he could
never look upon them, without thinking of the awful
ruin into which he must soon be plunged by the fall.
But this would both operate as a discouragement to
all endeavors at steadfastness, and at the same time
would exhibit the All-Benevolent God as marring the
happiness of an innocent creature;&mdash;an idea never to
be admitted. We conclude, therefore, that the Sabbath,
as originally instituted, possessed nothing of a
ceremonial character. Typical institutions were introduced
<i>after</i> the fall, to explain to ruined man the
nature of that redemption of which he stood in need,
and which in the fulness of the time would be provided
for him. They were for his encouragement and
consolation:&mdash;not to mar his happiness, but to promote
it.</p>

<p>To evade the force of this argument, some contend
that the Sabbath was not actually instituted and given
to man in Paradise; that the sanctification of it mentioned
by Moses, signifies only that appointment then
made of the seventh day, to be afterwards solemnized
and sanctified by the Jews. But the utter futility of
this objection appears from our Savior's declaration
that "the Sabbath was made for man." Mark ii.&nbsp;27.
If it was made for man, it was made for him <i>as</i>
<span class="pagenum">{2-4}</span>
man; the very word denoting mankind at large, or
rather, referring to the first man as the representative
of the whole human race. It was made for him as a
human, rational, intelligent creature; for his benefit
<i>as such</i>, without reference to the particular nation or
country to which he might belong. If it was made
for his benefit, is it reasonable to suppose that it was,
nevertheless, kept in abeyance for twenty-five hundred
years? Made for man, and yet not given to
him! The world teeming with human beings, and
yet the very institution that was designed for their
temporal and spiritual welfare, kept from them for
more than two thousand years, and then given only
to an isolated people forming but a fraction of the human
race! The idea is monstrous absurdity. An
institution so important to the interests of humanity,
of civilization, and of religion, was wanted immediately,
as well as at the distance of two thousand years
afterwards.</p>

<p>The objection is farther confuted by a consideration
of the reason which enforces the institution. The
reason is, "that God rested on the seventh day from
all his work which he had made." The natural inference
is, that the institution existed from the time
the reason of it did. Human legislators, it is true,
may not enact a law, until long after a good reason
exists for doing so; because they may be blind to the
existence of such a reason, and slow to discover it.
But not so with God. If the work of creation, and
his resting from it on the seventh day, is at any period
of the world a good reason that man should rest
on that day, it was a good reason from the beginning.
It was good as soon as there were men to do it. So
that what was then their reasonable service, could not
have been deferred for twenty-five hundred years.
Nay, it may be safely affirmed, that the reason for
<span class="pagenum">{2-5}</span>
keeping the Sabbath possessed more cogency at the
beginning than it did afterwards. For in after ages
sin had marred and defaced the Almighty's work.
Nevertheless, if when sin had marred it, there was
still good reason for keeping the memorial of it, much
more was there good reason for doing so, when it was
in all its original glory. In what respect does or did
this reason concern the Jews more than any other part
of mankind? Do not Gentiles stand on the same
level with them in respect of their being a part of
God's creation? Have they not as much interest in
creation as the Jews? "Is He the God of the Jews
only? Is He not of the Gentiles also?"</p>

<p>The reasons for such institutions as were enjoined
on the Jews particularly, were derived from considerations
in which they as a people had a special and peculiar
interest. Now the Sabbath, it is true, is in one
place enforced upon them by a consideration of this
kind, viz. their redemption from bondage in Egypt,
Deut. v.&nbsp;15. But while this laid the Jews under a
special and peculiar obligation to regard the institution,
it does not forbid the idea that they were also
under obligations of a general nature, which concern
all mankind alike. So too, the Christian church is
under a special obligation too keep this sacred day,
because of its interest in the blood of redemption.
But to infer from this, that the common obligation under
which all others are held is canceled, and that
none are bound to keep it except the blood-bought
church of God, would be in the last degree illogical,
as well as unscriptural.</p>

<p>Let it be observed, that the language of the sacred
historian: "God blessed the seventh day and sanctified
it"&mdash;is no more qualified, than that which speaks
of his resting. With reference to this, his language
is explicit,&mdash;"He rested on the seventh day from all
<span class="pagenum">{2-6}</span>
his work which he had made." In face of such a declaration,
nothing but folly would say, that God did
not actually rest on the seventh day of creation, but
waited until the Jews were called out of Egypt.
God certainly did rest on the seventh day of creation.
If the ordinary construction of language is to
be employed in reference to this, it must be employed
in reference to his blessing and sanctifying it also.
Wherefore, as God rested on the seventh day of creation,
he blessed and sanctified that day, even that very
day on which he rested. "God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it, because that in <i>it</i>, (the very
day which he so blessed and sanctified,) he had rested
from all his work which God created and made."
Gen. ii.&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>The act of blessing and sanctifying the day can
import nothing else than constituting it a Sabbath.
For to sanctify, undoubtedly, is to set apart for a holy
use. It refers to some line of conduct to be observed
by men towards that day. The expression, "God
blessed it," must mean that he rendered it a day peculiarly
happy and beneficial for man. For whenever
God blesses an object, whether it be a person
or an inanimate thing&mdash;a rational creature or the
brute creation&mdash;he connects with his blessing certain
favors which would otherwise not be bestowed, and
renders the object serviceable for the promotion of
certain purposes which would not result without his
blessing. A few examples will render this perfectly
clear. Thus, when he blessed the first human pair,
and the brute creation, he bestowed on them the power
to be "fruitful and multiply." When the ground
receiveth blessing from God, it bringeth forth herbs,
meet for them by whom it is dressed. When it is
cursed, it bears thorns and briars, Heb. vi.&nbsp;7, 8. Gen.
xxvii.&nbsp;27. Lev. xxv.&nbsp;21. Mal. iii.&nbsp;10. When God
<span class="pagenum">{2-7}</span>
blessed Abraham, he bestowed on him a numerous
posterity, with Canaan for an inheritance, and counted
his faith for righteousness. In blessing Samson, Judges
xiii.&nbsp;24, he endowed him with an heroic spirit,
singular valor, miraculous strength of body, and all
other gifts and graces necessary to his calling. When
he blesses the church, he bestows spiritual blessings
in Christ, Eph. i.&nbsp;3. Numerous other examples
might be adduced: but these are sufficient to show,
that in connection with the Divine blessing, special
favors are always bestowed. We therefore argue,
that when it is said, "God blessed the seventh day,"
it can mean nothing less than that he connected with
it favors and benefits above what are connected with
any other day, and that he bestows them abundantly
upon those who keep it, and delight in it, Isa. lviii.&nbsp;13.
He renders the day serviceable for the promotion
of the spiritual and temporal welfare of man. For it
can by no means be supposed, that God proposed to
render homage to himself, or to bless himself. It
must be man, for whom the Sabbath was made, Mark
ii.&nbsp;27, that stands in need of the blessing, and who is
bound to make a holy use of the day.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks are judged sufficient to destroy
the notion of the Sabbath being a ceremonial
institution. But we will not yet dismiss the subject. If
it was a ceremony, why was its importance magnified
above all the other ceremonies? Why that pre-eminence
and sanctity, which it had above all other
types? It rears its head high above all the ritual
institutions, and holds this superiority throughout the
whole Mosaic Economy. Not only is it counted
worthy of being graven by the finger of God upon
the stone tablets, thus having the same honor as all
the other precepts of the Decalogue, which are confessedly
moral; but even where it appears in combination
<span class="pagenum">{2-8}</span>
with the ceremonial usages, its great importance
as a moral institute directed to the highest ends,
is clearly exhibited.</p>

<p>"For first, after the record of the promulgation of
the Decalogue, three chapters of judicial statutes follow;
but in the midst of these, the people are reminded
of the essential importance of the Sabbath, in
a manner quite distinct and peculiar. It is associated
with the primary duty of worshiping the one true
God, as of equal obligation, and indeed as necessary
to it. 'Six days shalt thou do thy work, and on the
seventh thou shalt rest, * * in all things that I
have said unto thee, be circumspect, and make no
mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be
heard out of thy mouth,' Exod. xxiii.&nbsp;12, 13. This
is sufficiently remarkable.</p>

<p>"Again, after six chapters more concerning the
tabernacle and its various sacrifices, the whole communication
of the forty days' abode on the mount is
concluded with a re-inculcation of the Sabbath-rest,
in a manner the most solemn and affecting. 'And
the Lord spake unto Moses saying, verily my Sabbath
ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and
you throughout your generations, <span class="smcap">that ye may know
that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you</span>.
Ye shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy
unto you; every one that defileth it shall surely be
put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein,
that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is
the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord; whosoever
doeth any work in the Sabbath-day, he shall surely
be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel
shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath
throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
It is a sign between me and the children of
<span class="pagenum">{2-9}</span>
Israel forever, for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was
refreshed.' Exod. xxxi.&nbsp;12-17. Can anything give
dignity to the sacred day, as founded in the essential
relation of man to his Maker and Redeemer, if this
sublime language does not? Every idea of sanctification,
every sense of importance from a sign of a
covenant between God and man, every sanction derived
from the awful punishment of death, unite to
impress upon us the duty; whilst the proportion noted
between the working days and the day of rest,
and the reason drawn from the order of creation, extend
the obligation to every human being."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>This great prominence which the Sabbath had
amidst all the ceremonial laws, was equivalent to an
intimation that the ritual service must never take the
precedence of moral duties; that in the multitude of
their offerings and shadowy service, the worshipers
must still remember that true holiness does not consist
in them, but in something higher; and that all
their conformity to the ritual service must proceed
upon moral footing, otherwise it is abomination in
the sight of God.</p>

<p>But come with me, reader, a little farther, and see
how the scriptures magnify the Sabbath at the very
time they comparatively underrate the importance of
ceremonial observances. Compare carefully Isa. i.&nbsp;11-14,
with chapters lvi.&nbsp;1-8, and lviii.&nbsp;13, 14, of the
same prophecy. See how in the one case the ritual
service is degraded, and in the other the Sabbath is
exalted, and the holy keeping of it made the condition
on which depends the acceptance of their
burnt-offerings and sacrifices. Consider the language
of Jeremiah. chap. xvii.&nbsp;19-27. Read the passage
<span class="pagenum">{2-10}</span>
with care, and see how all the prosperity of the
nation, all the favor of God, is suspended on this
one branch of moral obedience; with which compare
his language concerning ceremonial observances.
"For I spake not unto your fathers, nor
commanded them in the day that I brought them out
of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or
sacrifices: But this thing commanded I them, saying,
Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall
be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I
have commanded you, that it may be well unto you,"
Jer. vii.&nbsp;22, 23. A comparison of these passages
shows that Sabbath-breaking stood upon the same
level with the breach of all moral precepts, and
characterized them as a disobedient and rebellious
people; while the neglect of ceremonial observances is
classed in a different category. Ezekiel follows in
the same strain, chap. xx.&nbsp;12, 13, 16. In the book
of Psalms too, we have the Sabbath and its holy duties
and pleasures extolled, Ps. xcii, while ceremonies
are depreciated, Ps. 1. 8, 14, li.&nbsp;16, 17. And
what was the great reformation which the prophets
after the captivity sought to accomplish? Was not
Sabbath-breaking the crying sin upon which they
dwelt? Look at the holy zeal of Nehemiah. His
faithful and searching rebukes proceed not upon their
omission of ceremonial duties, but upon their neglect
of the great and paramount duty of keeping the Sabbath,
Neh. xiii.&nbsp;15, 21, 23. In view of these scripture
references, does the Sabbath look like a ceremony&mdash;a
shadow&mdash;a mere element of the world, weak
and beggarly!</p>

<p>Again, if the Sabbath was a part of the ceremonial
law, why was Christ at such pains to regulate the
manner of observing it? Matt. xii.&nbsp;1, 13. Why so
careful to modify the false usages that obtained?
<span class="pagenum">{2-11}</span>
Why did he lay down distinctions between what is
lawful to be done, and what is unlawful? Was this
his manner when any thing ceremonial was the subject
of dispute? Do we not find him, in such cases,
waiving the subject at issue, in order to inculcate matters
of lasting importance? How was it in his interview
with the Samaritan woman? John iv. Her
question in regard to the proper place of worship was
merely of a ceremonial nature, yet it had been hotly
disputed between her nation and the Jews. Does
Jesus become an umpire in the case? No. The ceremonial
institutions were about to vanish away; He
himself came to end them. Therefore he occupies
himself, not in settling the litigated questions that
grew out of them, but in preaching great and everlasting
truths. In regard to the Moral Law, however,
he is at especial pains to vindicate if from all
Pharisaic austerities, to remove all false glosses, and
to assert its everlasting equity and glory. Witness
his admirable exposition of it in his sermon on the
mount. Witness too, his exposure of the hypocritical
tradition concerning the fifth commandment.
Matt. xv.&nbsp;1-9. With this, his vindication of the
Sabbath, his care to purge it from traditional corruptions,
is perfectly parallel. But what sane mind ever
thought that he proclaimed the fifth commandment to
be of a ceremonial nature? Yet, strange to say, the
precisely similar course which he took in regard to the
Sabbath, has, by some, been made an argument that
he abolished it as nothing but a Jewish ceremony.</p>

<p>'But drowning men catch at straws.' In spite of
the overwhelming proof that the Sabbath had its
origin before ceremonial observances could, with any
reason, have been introduced, it is contended that it
must have been merely a Mosaic institution, because
no mention is made of its observance from the creation
<span class="pagenum">{2-12}</span>
down to the time of the exodus of the Israelites from
Egypt. It is asked, 'whether men during all that
time, though otherwise so wicked, sanctified the Sabbath
so universally and perfectly, that not one among
them ever needed an excitement to duty, or a reproof
for the neglect of it.' But to this question, however
triumphantly proposed, we are as ready to answer, No,
as the objector himself. That the great mass of men,
during all this time, were wicked and sinners before
the Lord exceedingly, is admitted. But because they
were not particularly reproved for Sabbath-breaking,
no more proves that it was not a sin cognizable by
the moral law, than the fact of God's winking at the
times of the Gentiles' ignorance and idolatry, Acts
xvii.&nbsp;30, proves that their conduct was not cognizable
as a sin against his law. If God passed over the
Sabbath-breaking of those who lived in the first ages
of the world without particularly taking notice of it,
the same may be said of his carriage towards the
Gentile world, in reference to <i>all</i> their wickedness for
four thousand years. Besides, is not the drunkeness
of Noah passed over without reproof? Is not Lot's
incest with his daughters?&mdash;and Jacob's cheating Esau
of the patrimony?&mdash;and the plurality of the patriarchs'
wives? Were these things not contrary to the Divine
Law, because they were "winked at?" Or, to
come to cases still more in point, we observe that the
silence of scripture respecting the observance of the
Sabbath during the ante-Mosaic age, is no more than
what occurs in regard to the period between Moses
and the time of David, near four hundred years. Yet
who ever doubted that it was observed during all this
time? So also the rite of circumcision is not so much
as alluded to from a little after the death of Moses,
till the days of Jeremiah, a period of eight hundred
years or more. Nor is the ordinance of the red
<span class="pagenum">{2-13}</span>
heifer once mentioned from the Pentateuch till the
close of the Old Testament. But who doubts the
constant observance of these ceremonies? The objection,
therefore, which is raised from the silence of
Scripture, has no force whatever.</p>

<p>But whoever considers the very concise manner in
which events are narrated in scripture, and that the
history of two thousand years is all compressed within
the compass of fifty short chapters, occupying about
as many pages, will cease to wonder that no notice is
taken of the observance of the Sabbath by the pious
patriarchs. This very conciseness is a sufficient solution
to a candid mind, without resorting to the supposition
that there was no observance of the institution.
Moreover, any one that peruses with attention the
accounts of pious characters contained in the word of
God, will see that no express mention is made of their
acts of religion, unless something remarkable attaches
to them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
Abraham's faith is mentioned, because it
was remarkable. So of Abel, of Noah, and of Enoch.
But in regard to their observance of the Sabbath in
particular, it is not probable that anything remarkable
or extraordinary was connected with it, rendering it
of sufficient importance to the world at large to be
recorded.</p>

<p>The position that we have taken is, that the
Sabbath was instituted in Paradise, when man was
innocent; that it was binding before Judaism had any
existence. We have seen that the silence of scripture
as to any reproof given to the transgressor of it, does
not shake this position; that its silence as to any
commendation bestowed upon the pious for keeping it,
does not shake it; and that its entire silence is no
more than what obtains with regard to the Sabbath
<span class="pagenum">{2-14}</span>
from Moses to David, or with regard to circumcision
from Joshua to Jeremiah, or with regard to the red
heifer from Moses to the end of the Old Testament.
Is there any thing yet remaining to weaken the force
of our arguments?</p>

<p>In the opinion of our opponents there is one thing
more. It is argued, from Ex. xvi., that the Sabbath
was first made known to the Israelites in the wilderness,
by the falling of the manna. But we can discover
nothing in the whole history of the matter, as
given by Moses, which intimates that the Sabbath
was then made known for the first. On the contrary,
the abruptness of the reference implies very strongly
the previous knowledge of it. This idea receives
strong confirmation from the fact, that when the people
were reminded of the institution, nothing was said
to them concerning the reason of its being their duty
to keep it; which would hardly have been the case,
had the subject been then presented to them for the
first time. For it is worthy of note, that God condescends
to give the reason of this command; a thing
which he does not for moral precepts in general. He
gives the reason, because man cannot discover it for
himself, it being purely a matter of revelation that
God made the world in six days, and rested on the
seventh. Whereas, other moral precepts are more
readily discoverable from the light of nature. Now,
if God condescends in any place, and at any time, to
give the reason for a command, we might expect it
would be at the time of its first promulgation. In
Gen. ii., where we suppose the law to be first given,
the reason accompanies it; but in the passage now
under consideration it does not.</p>

<p>Again, it is nowhere in the context intimated that
the object of giving the manna was to make known
the Sabbath. On the contrary, the declared object of
<span class="pagenum">{2-15}</span>
supplying their wants in this miraculous manner, was
to make the Israelites know that it was the Lord
Jehovah who brought them out of Egypt, v.&nbsp;6, and
not Moses and Aaron, as they intimated, v.&nbsp;3, to make
them know that the Lord was their God, v.&nbsp;12, and
to prove them, whether they would manifest their
gratitude for his merciful interposition in their favor,
by walking in his law, or no, v.&nbsp;4. This was the express
and primary object. To make known the Sabbath
is not even hinted as having been the <i>subordinate</i>,
much less the <i>principal</i> object.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.<br /><br />
    argument from the decalogue.</span></h3>

<p>We commenced this essay with the design of showing
that the Sabbath is a necessary part of the immutable
law of God&mdash;that law which is "holy, and just,
and good;" which is "spiritual;" to which nothing
is opposed but that which is carnal. Hitherto, we
have rested none of our proofs upon the fact, that it
was incorporated in the Decalogue; that it is one of
the <span class="smcap">ten words</span> "which God spake in the Mount, out
of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
darkness, with a great voice; and he added no more."
Deut. v.&nbsp;22. For to assume that the Decalogue, as
such, is the moral law, and that the Sabbath, because
it makes a part of it, is therefore everlastingly binding,
may not be satisfactory to some of our readers.</p>

<p>That the Decalogue, as such, held a peculiar aspect
towards the Jews, different from that which it holds
towards any others, is freely admitted. It made a
part of their civil code; it was incorporated with
their political laws, and, therefore, temporal penalties
were annexed, which were inflicted by the civil magistrate.
<span class="pagenum">{2-16}</span>
Offences against the most of its precepts
were punishable by death, Sabbath-breaking not excepted.
Hence some contend that these precepts
ought not to be called, by way of eminence, "<i>the</i>
Moral Law;" that the fact of their having been
graven upon stone, and given under circumstances of
greater pomp and glory than the other precepts of the
Old Testament, constitutes no solid argument for their
being so called. The greater glory of their promulgation
from the Mount of God, is supposed to be
sufficiently accounted for, by considering them as the
<i>Constitution</i>, or <i>Grand Platform</i>, upon which was
based the whole of that system which was peculiar
to the Jews. The Decalogue, therefore, is supposed
to bear about the same relation to the other precepts
spoken by Moses, as <i>constitution</i> bears to <i>statute law</i>.
This view is thought to be favored by those passages
which call the stone tables "the tables of the Covenant."
Heb. ix.&nbsp;4. Hence, as they say, the Covenant
being abrogated, the tables of the Covenant are
set aside also; on the same principle that when a
political government is dissolved the constitution is
of no farther use.</p>

<p>Upon this seemingly plausible argument we offer
the following remarks:</p>

<p>1. Admitting that the Decalogue is the grand constitution
of the Jewish polity, and that it has an excellence
over the other precepts spoken by Moses,
precisely like that of constitution over statute law;
still we think it could not, in the nature of things, be
any thing less than a code of morals. There was a
necessity of the strongest kind, that it should embody
all the essential elements of the moral law. For, as
obedience to statute law must proceed from constitutional
principles, so the obedience of the Israelites to
the whole system of Moses must proceed upon moral
<span class="pagenum">{2-17}</span>
footing. Any other obedience than this&mdash;any obedience
which is of an inferior kind, God does not require,
and cannot, consistently with his holy nature.
No matter what is the nature of the precepts He gives,
obedience to them must be upon moral principle. A
love for the great principles of righteousness must regulate
it all; for this only is the pledge that they will
rigidly, and without deviation, conform to any system
that He enjoins upon them. Therefore, the Moral
Law, or rather the essential elements of it, go before
all the other laws He gave to the children of Israel.
If they will keep this law, which they promised to do,
Exod. xix.&nbsp;8, it is a pledge that they will keep all the
rest.</p>

<p>2. Though the covenant character of the Decalogue
is abolished, by reason of the Sinaitic Covenant being
entirely abrogated, the moral character of it remains
untouched, and just the same as it was before a covenant
was based upon it. Hence, though we are under
no covenant obligation to its precepts, we are under
a moral obligation to them. The Jews were under a
covenant obligation to the Decalogue, brought upon
them by the transaction at Sinai. But Jews and
Gentiles were alike under moral obligation to its precepts,
antecedently to the covenant made at Sinai.
Let men learn to distinguish between covenant obligation
and moral obligation, and they will have no
difficulty on this point.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>3. If the covenant character of the Decalogue is
abolished, and all covenant obligation destroyed along
with it, of course those temporal penalties which
<span class="pagenum">{2-18}</span>
were annexed to its precepts are also abolished. But
the moral penalty, the death of the soul, remains to
be inflicted upon every impenitent transgressor.
Hence the Sabbath-breaker, as well as the idolator,
the profane swearer, and the adulterer, though not
obnoxious to death, as the despiser of Moses' law, is
yet obnoxious to the curse of God, and must inherit it
by being punished with everlasting destruction from
His presence, and from the glory of His power.</p>

<p>What is it then? Not only do the ten commandments
possess a moral character, independent of their
inscription upon the stone tablets, as the grand constitutional
platform of the Jewish Theocracy; but
they possess this moral character <span class="smcap">because</span> they compose
this constitution. For the constitution, as we
have already proved, could not, in the nature of things,
be any thing else than a summary of moral precepts.
Therefore, as the Sabbath is one of these precepts, it
is a part of the moral law, and remains of everlasting
force and obligation.</p>

<p>In our defense of the ten commandments, we do
<i>not</i> "contradistinguish them from the rest by calling
the former exclusively <i>the</i> moral law, and all the other
divine instructions of the Jews, through Moses, <i>the</i>
ceremonial law." We not only admit, but strongly
insist, that moral duties are inculcated elsewhere besides
in the Decalogue. "When the Jews are told,
Exod. xxii.&nbsp;22, <i>Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless
child</i>, we need no scholastic definitions to
enable us to recognize this as a part of the moral
code."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
But we <i>do</i> suppose that the Decalogue
comprises the <i>elementary principles</i> of the moral law.
We suppose, that whatever moral duty is inculcated
elsewhere, it is deducible from one or other of the ten
<span class="pagenum">{2-19}</span>
commandments. We can hardly imagine a single
condition in which it is possible for man to be placed
in this life, or a relation that he sustains, which is not
cognizable by this code.</p>

<p>Our doctrine receives strength from the prominence
given to the Decalogue in the New Testament. No
small degree of honor is put upon it by the Savior, in
his Sermon on the Mount, an important part of that
celebrated discourse being occupied with expositions
of its precepts, and applications of them to the conduct
of men, as the subjects of God's moral government.
Again, when the young man came to Christ,
and asked, "What good thing shall I do that I may
inherit eternal life," he was told to keep the commandments.
That by these were meant the precepts
of the Decalogue, is evident from the Savior's immediately
beginning to quote those precepts. Matt. xix.&nbsp;16-19.
The fact that they were enjoined with reference
to <i>eternal</i> life, proves conclusively that their
bearing was not merely upon the conduct of men as
citizens of the Jewish commonwealth, but upon their
conduct as moral and accountable creatures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
Again, when the Apostle inculcates those duties which are
the mark of love to our neighbor, he quotes the precepts
of the second table of the Decalogue. Rom.
xiii.&nbsp;9. It is evident, also, that Paul refers particularly
to the Decalogue as the law which convinced
him of sin. Rom. vii.&nbsp;7. For he cites the tenth
precept of it, as showing him that strong desire after
things forbidden is sin. This is the commandment
which, being powerfully applied to his heart, made
sin to revive, and he died: ver. 9. Hence he includes
<span class="pagenum">{2-20}</span>
the Decalogue, when he speaks of that law
which is "spiritual, and holy, and just, and good:"
vs. 12, 14; to which the carnal mind, refusing subjection,
is therefore enmity against God. Rom. viii.&nbsp;7.
One more example. Paul writing, not to Jews,
but to converts from among the Gentiles, recognizes
the usual arrangement of the Decalogue, and its validity
as a rule of duty under the Gospel, when he
says, concerning filial obedience, that it is the first
commandment which has a promise annexed to it.
Eph. vi.&nbsp;1, 2. In the following verse he states what
the promise is, presenting it as a motive to obedience.
This proves that no commandment had been changed
or dispossessed of its place.</p>

<p>In asserting the importance of the Decalogue, the
reader will observe that we do not particularly insist
upon the manner and circumstances of its promulgation.
We dwell not upon the fact of its having been
written with God's own finger upon stone, while
Mosaic institutions were engrossed by Moses himself
upon parchment. We dwell not upon the thunderings,
lightnings, thick clouds, the loud blast of the
trumpet, and the voice of Jehovah from the midst of
the fire; all which conspire to throw around the ten
commandments a glory not belonging to the ceremonial
precepts. These things we pass, aware that
men will evade the argument from them, by the supposition
that they prove nothing more than that kind
of superiority which the constitution of a state has
over statute law. We can hardly refrain, however,
from observing, as we pass, that as the ark was the
throne of God, Exod. xxv.&nbsp;22, Num. vii.&nbsp;89, xvii.&nbsp;4,
Ps. xcix.&nbsp;1&mdash;it is difficult to conceive how righteousness
and judgment were the habitation of his throne,
Ps xcvii.&nbsp;2, if the "ten words" which were there
deposited were not designed to be an expression of
<span class="pagenum">{2-21}</span>
His perfections, and the eternal rule of right to His
creatures.</p>

<p>But we think we have placed the morality of the
Decalogue upon grounds that cannot be successfully
disputed. Having thus secured it, we advert to the
foregoing circumstances, not as direct proof of the
truth of our argument, but as so much collateral evidence.
There is one circumstance, however, which
ought not to be passed over lightly. The tables of
stone were deposited in the ark, and covered over by
the mercy seat. On the great day of atonement, when
the High Priest entered into the Most Holy, he
sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice upon this mercy
seat, and upon the floor before it, thus making an
atonement for the sins of the people. But did this
blood in reality atone for the sins of the people against
that law which was concealed under the mercy seat?
No. Not only was it no atonement for moral offences,
Heb. x.&nbsp;4, but it was not even an atonement for their
political violation of this code. For such violation,
in regard to most of its precepts, was a capital crime,
and could not be expiated under that covenant. The
whole process, therefore, was typical or prefigurative
of the grand atonement made for the sins of the
world by Jesus Christ, the High-Priest of our profession.
Heb. iii.&nbsp;1. The argument derived from it
in favor of the Decalogue is, that what the law by its
offerings could not do, God, sending his own son in the
likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in
the flesh. Rom. viii.&nbsp;3. For Christ enters into the
Most Holy, even unto Heaven itself, with his own
blood, and makes a real atonement for sins. In other
words, the legal sacrifices could not reach to sins
against the Decalogue, but Christ's sacrifice did, and
therefore the superiority of the gospel over the law is
fully established. But the whole argument for the
<span class="pagenum">{2-22}</span>
superiority of the Christian sacrifice becomes null and
void, on the supposition that the atonement had reference
to any other law than the Decalogue.</p>

<p>Now if the Decalogue, as a whole, has a claim to
be called a summary of the moral law, the Sabbath
derives in this way no small degree of authority, For
it is a very important part of the Ten Words, standing
right in the very heart of them, and bound up along
with them; so that, whatever dignity and excellence
the rest have, this has also. We are, therefore, driven
to the conclusion, that when the Savior says, "One
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,"
the Sabbath is alluded to as much as any other precept.
That when the Apostle teaches, the law is not
made void through faith, Rom. iii.&nbsp;31, he means,
among other things, that the Sabbath is not made
void by the gospel, but rather established. That
when he says "the law is spiritual," Rom. vii.&nbsp;14, he
means that the Sabbath law, as well as all other precepts,
is spiritual; and that none reject it but those
who are "carnal, sold under sin."</p>

<p>But we shall hear it objected, that the fourth
commandment is not transferred to the New Testament,
and re-enacted there, while all the other commandments
are. This, however, is taking a wrong
view of the case, altogether. The truth is, that no
moral precept is re-enacted in the New Testament.
What necessity is there for re-enacting laws which
never expired? The very notion of re-enacting implies
their previous expiration. Wherefore, if those
precepts of the moral law which we find in the New
Testament are there for no other reason than because
they are re-enacted, it follows that they must have
expired with the Old Covenant. If they expired
with it, they were peculiar to it, and must have had
their origin in it. If they were peculiar to it, and
<span class="pagenum">{2-23}</span>
originated in it, then all obligation to obey them was
merely covenant obligation, while moral or natural
obligation is supposed to have had no existence.
But this conclusion is an absurdity, and if carried out
still farther, leads to multiplied absurdities.</p>

<p>Whatever laws are enacted in the New Testament,
are altogether new and peculiar to that covenant of
which Jesus is the mediator. They emanated from
him in his character of Head of the Church. Baptism
is one of them. It is, however, a new institution,
peculiar to the New Covenant, and was not brought
over from the old. The Lord's Supper is another,
yet it is a new Covenant ordinance entirely, and
therefore, like baptism, is to be observed only by believers.
But as for the <i>re-enacting</i> of laws, it is a
thing altogether unknown in the New Covenant, and
inconsistent with its nature.</p>

<p>The notion of the necessity of re-enacting the Sabbath
in the New Testament, arises altogether from
supposing that it is a covenant institution or church
ordinance. But if it is a church ordinance, it can be
binding upon none but believers; on the same principle
that the ordinances of the Mosaic church were
binding upon none but Jews. Is any one prepared
to take this ground? We think not. Those who
acknowledge the necessity of any Sabbath whatever,
consider the observance of it a duty devolving upon
men irrespective of their connection with the church,
binding them in the isolated and individual capacity,
even though church privileges were altogether out of
the question. Were an individual abiding in some
lone cavern of the Rocky Mountains, or roaming the
uninhabited and trackless wastes of the earth, far, far
from scenes of busy life, the law of God still binds
him "to remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy."</p>

<p>The truth is, the Sabbath is not properly an ordinance
<span class="pagenum">{2-24}</span>
of either of the covenants. It originated in
neither of them, but was in existence long before any
covenant was revealed to man. Hence, after the Old
Covenant was abrogated, it remained just what it
was before. So that if, in the history of the New
Covenant, or what is commonly called the New
Testament, there was not one word of allusion to the
Sabbath in particular, it would not affect the argument
in the least.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{2-25}</span>
But is it true, that the Sabbath is not sanctioned
by the New Testament? What means our Savior's
course in regulating the manner of its observance, in
vindicating it from Pharisaic austerities, determining
what is lawful to be done, &amp;c., Matt. xii.&nbsp;1-13. It
can mean nothing else than sanctioning it, as a precept
of the moral law, as we have already shown in our
remarks upon this text, p. 10. But even if this
express sanction were wholly wanting, inasmuch as
it is a part of the moral law, as we have clearly proved,
it stands firm, unaltered, and unalterable, receiving,
from the very nature of the case, all the sanction of
the New Covenant. It is impossible for the New
Covenant to affect it in any other way than to strengthen
and uphold it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.<br /><br />
    relation of the sabbath to positive institutions</span></h3>

<p>Is there then no difference between the law of the
Sabbath and the other precepts of the decalogue?
We do not mean to say there is no difference whatever.
There is something in it which partakes of the
nature of a <i>positive institution</i>, as theologians are
<span class="pagenum">{2-26}</span>
pleased to term it. Positive institutions are generally
considered to be such as are not discoverable by the
light of nature, their obligation resting upon the mere
will of the Lawgiver. While on the other hand, moral
precepts are supposed to be ascertained by the light
of nature, and to be binding independently of any
appointment of the Lawgiver.</p>

<p>We are free to admit the positive nature of the
Sabbatic institution, so far as it respects the particular
day to be observed, and the proportion of time; also
as it respects the great reason on which the law is
founded. For it is not a dictate of nature, that one
seventh part of time is more holy, or has any more
demand upon us in a religious way, than one tenth,
or one fifth, or any other proportion. Nor is it a dictate
of nature, that God created the world in six days,
and rested on the seventh, blessing and sanctifying <i>it</i>.
The light of nature, it is true, teaches that the world
was created by eternal Power; but it gives no information
of the time occupied in it, nor of the fact of
His resting on the seventh day, after it was finished.
Therefore, so far as the mere light of nature is concerned,
we are left in the dark respecting what constitutes
the very foundation of the institution.</p>

<p>But after all, we very much doubt the propriety of
classing all those precepts which we cannot discover
by the mere light of nature, under the sweeping name
of positive institutions, as if they were on the same
level with the passover, circumcision, the ordinance
of the red heifer, &amp;c. Indeed, we utterly protest
against it, if the intention is to underrate their importance,
or to depreciate them as "<i>non-essential</i>,"
according to the cant term of the day. For what in
such case would become of the whole system of
Christianity itself? We mean the system of appointing
a Mediator, and the redemption of the world
<span class="pagenum">{2-27}</span>
through him. It is a positive institution, that is,
purely a matter of revelation, and wholly undiscoverable
by the light of nature. But shall we therefore
call it a non-essential? Shall we regard it as something
of minor importance in comparison with the religion
of nature? Does it not devolve upon us with
obligations just as strong and overwhelming as the
moral law? Most certainly it does; not only because
it is enjoined by the same authority, but also because
it is the only means of promoting a conformity to the
moral law. The same may be said of all positive institutions:
they are designed to promote a conformity
first to that dispensation to which they are peculiar,
and second, to the moral law.</p>

<p>Whoever attempts a close investigation of the nature
of positive institutions, will find that the line of
separation between them and moral duties, is not always
so easy to be drawn as might at first be imagined.
We say, indeed, that the former are not discoverable
by the light of nature. The reason of that,
however, may be, not because they do not in reality
originate in the nature of things, but merely because,
our powers of discovery are so feeble. Were these
powers expanded, and the range of our intellectual
vision widened, we might possibly see that those very
institutions we call positive, grow naturally and necessarily
out of the relation between God and us.
Not only might we see the reasons of positive institutions
in general, (which indeed is already sufficiently
obvious,) but with such enlarged capacities,
we might see the reason why such particular ones are
pitched upon rather than others. The real difference
between moral and positive duties may, after all, be
nothing more than this, that the former we can readily
discover for ourselves, narrow as the range of our
vision is&mdash;while the latter, we are so short-sighted,
<span class="pagenum">{2-28}</span>
we cannot discover, and are therefore wholly dependent
on revelation for them. Hence we suppose it is
assuming more than can be proved, when it is argued
that positive appointments are altogether arbitrary,
and have no real foundation in the nature and fitness
of things.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now when we admit that the Sabbath is a positive
institution, we mean that it is not discoverable by the
light of nature, but is purely a matter of revelation;
and this is all we mean. It still possesses the main
attributes of a moral precept. For as we have already
shown, any duty which has its origin in the
natural relation of creature to Creator, must be of a
moral nature, whether we can discover it for ourselves,
<span class="pagenum">{2-29}</span>
or whether by reason of our short-sightedness,
we are altogether dependent on revelation for it.
That such is the origin of the Sabbath law, is plain
from the most casual inspection of it. It grew out of
God's creating the world in six days, and resting on
the seventh, and is a constant memorial of it. Besides,
it provides for the performance of the worship of God,
which is confessedly a moral duty; while the satisfaction
it yields to the conscience of every man, is a
sufficient indication of its parity with other moral
precepts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>But to dismiss all further argument concerning the
distinction between moral and positive duties, let it be
admitted that the Sabbath is a positive institution in
the very strictest sense; let it be admitted to be nothing
more than an arbitrary appointment, having no
foundation in the natural and primary relation of man
to his Creator&mdash;it must nevertheless remain in force
so long as that dispensation lasts to which it is peculiar.
Hence it must still be in force; for the dispensation
to which it belongs, is the dispensation of nature
itself. While the dispensation of nature lasts,
the day which God the Creator originally "blessed
and sanctified," will continue to be sacred. It is utterly
impossible that it should be otherwise; and
therefore all speculations about its changeable nature,
<span class="pagenum">{2-30}</span>
resulting from its being a positive appointment, are
vain. Changeable and positive as were the carnal
ordinances of the old economy, they were not changeable
while that economy lasted, but were sacred
throughout the whole of it. Changeable and positive
as are the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
they are not changeable while the dispensation
to which they belong continues, but are sacredly binding
until the dispensation ends. So of the Sabbath;
yes, even of the very day originally appointed.</p>

<p>Customary as it is with writers to draw the broad
line of distinction between what they call the <i>moral</i>
and <i>positive</i> parts of the institution, and whatever advantage
it may have in <i>theory</i>, so far as <i>practice</i> is
concerned, nothing is gained by it. Indeed, with
those who pretend to be guided by divine revelation,
rather than by the unaided deductions of their own
minds, it is always an unnecessary distinction. He
whose heart is subdued to the will of God, will not
be studious to inquire which of his commands are of
a moral, and which of a positive nature. His inquiry
will be simply this: "Lord, what wilt thou have me
to do?" If God command, he will obey, let the nature
of the command be what it will. Were man left
to deduce the knowledge of his duty from the nature
and fitness of things, without the aid of any light from
above, God would not blame him if he should wholly
neglect to practice those duties, which are commonly
called positive. All that would be required of him
in such case, would be the practice of those duties
which are most obviously of the moral kind. But
with the statute book of Almighty God in his hand,
he stands on very different ground. He is thus
brought under obligation&mdash;yea, under <i>moral</i> obligation,
to esteem <span class="smcap">all</span> the divine precepts concerning <i>all
things</i>, to be right. Psalm cxix.&nbsp;128.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{2-31}</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.<br /><br />
    the importance and necessity of the sabbatic institution.</span></h3>

<p>There are very few bearing the Christian name&mdash;perhaps
none except such as are a scandal to the profession&mdash;who
do not feel the importance of a weekly day
of rest, which shall be dedicated to the service of the
Most High God. Whatever may be their scruples in
regard to the application of the term <i>Sabbath</i>, to such
a day, and though they may suppose that it is not to
be observed according to the rigorous exactness of the
ancient law, they nevertheless feel that it would be
sapping the foundation of religion, morality, and good
order, to abolish all distinction of days, leaving none
for religious and moral improvement. Nay, even
those who, in theory, maintain that under the gospel
all days are alike, still feel&mdash;though it is difficult for
them to account for it&mdash;that their theory and their
experience will not harmonize together. Their very
nature calls for a day of repose, while the wants of
their souls are so clamorous as to drive them to some
moral and religious improvement of it. If they heed
not these monitions, they do but feel some aching void,
some uneasy distress, wholly unlike those peaceful
feelings which result from a due improvement of the
season. Whatever be a man's <i>theory</i>, he <i>feels</i> better
when he sanctifies one day in seven to the Lord: his
body feels better&mdash;his soul feels better. This feeling
is not one which grows out of the airy visions of a
distempered brain; but it is one which is capable of
being resolved into solid arguments.</p>

<p>Without a Sabbath, it would be utterly impossible
to promote the interests of religion. Were there no
set time for suspending the business of the world, the
<span class="pagenum">{2-32}</span>
church of God would soon lose its visibility, and hell
obtain complete triumph over the fallen soul of man.
Ministers might preach, embodying in their discourses
the most powerful reasoning, and garnishing the whole
with the sweetest flowers of rhetoric; but, to whom
would they preach? A few, of exalted piety, who
rejoice in the sacred testimonies more than in all riches,
and who feel that "a day in the courts of the
Lord is better than a thousand," Psalm lxxxiv.&nbsp;10,
would perhaps be there. But the mass&mdash;the throng&mdash;the
great multitude&mdash;would be elsewhere. They
would be immersed in the service of the world, their
souls perishing for lack of knowledge. It would be
impossible, utterly impossible to bring the word of
God to bear upon their minds. How then could they
be saved? For faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the word of God, Rom. x.&nbsp;17. And if men are not
brought to believe the gospel, what becomes of the
church? Its visibility is gone&mdash;the gates of hell
have prevailed against it. But God has sworn that
the church shall stand; nay, that all nations shall
flow unto it, Isa. ii.&nbsp;2. Wherefore, He who said "the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it," Matt. xvi.
18, is also Lord of the Sabbath for the benefit of the
church. As Lord of the Sabbath, he will forever
perpetuate an institution so necessary to the interests
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>This object&mdash;the promotion of Zion's welfare&mdash;could
not be accomplished, unless the day were strictly a
Sabbath; that is, a day of rest from all sorts of work.
It is not sufficient that the day be merely an honorable
day&mdash;a notable season, or a day for holding religious
meetings. If men are not obliged to intermit their
worldly business, and that too by the express authority
of God, they will give themselves but little trouble
to repair to a place of worship. Or even should
<span class="pagenum">{2-33}</span>
they go, their minds would be so filled with the world,
that the instructions from the desk would be as seed
cast upon the way side. Even with regard to the
Christian himself, how could the life of God be maintained
in his soul, by an attention to religious duties
just barely for the short space allotted to the public
assembly? It would be impossible. His soul would
be eaten up by the world. Public opportunities must
be followed up by secret prayer, and close meditation
in the sacred word. For this, one entire day in seven
is little enough. The experience of all devoted Christians&mdash;let
their theory about the Sabbath be what it
may&mdash;has taught them, that nothing less will suffice
to keep their souls in prosperity and health.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that we need just such a Sabbath
as the fourth commandment enjoins; one, the law of
which is, "in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger
that is within thy gates." If the great object of evangelizing
men, and bringing them to the knowledge and
worship of Jehovah cannot be accomplished with any
thing less than one entire day in seven, sanctified for
the purpose, then unquestionably we need a Sabbath.
It is therefore fair to presume, that the Sabbath of the
Decalogue was given with special reference to man's
necessities, and was not a mere <i>shadow</i> to be annulled
for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>

<p>The Sabbath is necessary to promote the growth
and strength of the moral principle. A man may
render obedience to all the other precepts of the moral
law; we may suppose them to be written on his heart;
we may even suppose them to be so perfectly wrought
into the temper and texture of his soul, that there is
no deviation whatever. By his obedience he gives
<span class="pagenum">{2-34}</span>
evidence of being in possession of the great principle
of holiness. But this principle lives not by its own
inherent vitality; it must be nourished and fed continually,
or it withers and dies. However holy, however
perfect the creature may be, he possesses no self-replenishing,
self-renovating principle,&mdash;he must constantly
resort to the great uncreated source for new
supplies. The contrary supposition makes him independent
of his Maker. Now the Sabbath is the season
set apart and sanctified by God Almighty for this
very purpose. It is the means of grace for keeping
alive the great moral principle&mdash;the season when the
creature goes right up to the Great Fountain, and
drinks of its invigorating streams, whereby he comes
forth rejoicing as a strong man to run a race. Hence
we find that even when man was innocent; when he
was in possession of the moral principle to perfection,
still he was not left without a Sabbath season for the
replenishing of his spiritual powers. If he needed a
Sabbath then, much more does he need it now. For
though he has been created anew in Christ Jesus,&mdash;the
principle of holiness being thus re-implanted&mdash;yet
has he a harder task to live holy to the Lord, inasmuch
as there is "a law in his members warring
against the law of his mind," "the flesh lusting
against the spirit." Therefore he needs all the aid
the Sabbath can bring to his soul. He needs "the
restoring, the awakening day&mdash;the day of recovery
and reformation&mdash;the day that brings him back to recollection,
to seriousness, to penitence, to prayer."
And when the last traces of sin shall have become obliterated,
and man put in possession of all that perfection
which pertains to the glorified state; still that
perfection, we believe, will not be sustained by its
own vitality, but will be preserved by means having
<span class="pagenum">{2-35}</span>
a similarity to those employed on earth. For it
is an everlasting Sabbath there, Heb. vi.&nbsp;9. Yes,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"&mdash;&mdash;there's a nobler rest above,</div>
<div class="line">To which our lab'ring souls aspire,</div>
<div class="line">With ardent pangs of strong desire."</div>
</div>

<p>But that the great importance of the Sabbatic Institution
may be more distinctly felt, let it be blotted
out from existence. Not only let the day which God
himself "sanctified and blessed," be disregarded; but
let there be no day whatever devoted as a season of
rest and religious improvement. Let every thing
which has the least semblance of the Sabbatic rest
be annihilated. What now is the state of morals?
What kind of order prevails in society? Why, men
are not ashamed when they commit abomination,
neither can they blush. They can glory in their
shame, and hell seems to be let loose. What is true
of communities, is also true of individuals. Such as
have disregarded all seasons and opportunities for instruction
in those principles which serve as restraints
upon the heart, have proceeded from bad to worse;
have become perfect pests of society, the ringleaders
of all wickedness, at the head of every miscreant
gang, foaming out their own shame, and ending their
career in a prison or on the gallows. Witness the
poor criminal, as he stands on the dividing line between
time and eternity, and his long-slumbering
conscience wakes up, and begins to speak out its
thunders. What does he say in that dread moment,
when he feels that the eye of God is directly upon
him? What!&mdash;Why, that in the beginning of his
career, all the powers of his nature called him to a
day of rest, and warned him not to trample upon seasons
devoted to moral and religious improvement;&mdash;that
he disregarded these monitions, until at length
the voice of conscience was hushed in silence, and
<span class="pagenum">{2-36}</span>
the work of death was easy. Therefore, says he,
I am a ruined man. Reader, when you contemplate
such facts, can you say that a Sabbath is not
necessary? Do you not see that the obliteration of
it is the brand upon the forehead of morality?</p>

<p>Need we, in this little essay, pause to consider the
bearing of the Sabbath upon the temporal welfare of
man? It is a matter so obvious, that we are almost
ashamed to make it the subject of a separate paragraph.
It is a fact well attested by experience, that
the human frame sinks under uninterrupted toil. The
utmost productive labor of man is in the proportion
of six days exertion to one of repose. So that the
Sabbath, instead of being an interruption to our necessary
business, is really a help to it. The utmost prolongation
of human life also, is in the like alternation
of toil and rest. While the poor beast of burden, if
doomed to continued service, drags out a miserable
existence, and at length sinks under the premature
exhaustion of his powers. What lustre, then, does
the Sabbath cast upon the benevolence of its Author.
What mercy, what God-breathed humanity appear
in this holy Institution. Let those who dwell in the
habitations of cruelty, be its enemies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section V.<br /><br />
    manner of observing the sabbath.</span></h3>

<p>Notwithstanding God has given the Sabbath for
the spiritual and temporal benefit of man, it is manifest
that we may suffer a woful loss of all the good
it proposes, if we neglect to make a proper improvement
of it. Like all the other means of grace, it may
prove a savor of death unto death to those who abuse
<span class="pagenum">{2-37}</span>
it. It therefore becomes a momentous inquiry, How
shall this holy day be observed?</p>

<p>This great institution is to be regarded as a weekly
testimony of our allegiance to Him who created us.
It thus becomes the mark of distinction between the
worshipers of Jehovah and heathens. This being
the case, it becomes a matter of thrilling importance
that the testimony of our allegiance be sincere, characterized
by nothing of hypocrisy or formality. If,
in all our acts of worship, we must be careful to worship
"in spirit and in truth," surely it is of the highest
importance to do so on this solemn occasion, when
the Great King comes down to test our loyalty. Let
it be remembered, too, that in this business there can
properly be no uninterested spectators. It is not for
a few to go through with the solemn act of dedicating
themselves, while the rest make it a mere holiday,
in which they look on, as boys witness the manouverings
of soldiers on parade day. But <i>all</i> the sons
and daughters of Adam&mdash;for all are alike the workmanship
of the Divine Being&mdash;are equally bound to
direct their eyes and their hearts to Him who made
them, and to say, "Come, let us join ourselves to the
Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>On this day we should by no means omit to celebrate
the praise of creation. To be a memorial of
this great work of the Almighty, the Sabbath was
originally instituted. Shall we then lose sight of the
original design of the institution, or even throw it into
the shade as a matter of secondary importance? Is
not the soundness of that system of theology to be
suspected, which would teach us to do so? Some,
it is true, teach us that the work of Redemption being
much more stupendous than that of creation, is therefore
to be made the chief object of our praise. But
<span class="pagenum">{2-38}</span>
however plausible this sentiment may seem, it is a
sufficient answer to say it is not contained in the Scriptures.
How much more vast the work of Redemption
is than that of creation, we pretend not to say, as
we are not able to measure the extent of either. To
say which work makes the most powerful impression
upon our minds, and fills us with more sublime ideas,
is more easy. But that is no criterion by which to
judge of their relative magnitude. Let it even be
conceded that Redemption exceeds in glory the work
of creation, still, whence do we <i>derive</i> those powers
by which we estimate its glory? Whence did we
obtain those faculties by which we contemplate the
great scheme of Redemption, and know that it is
glorious? Is it not to the wisdom and goodness of
God as displayed in creation, that we are indebted for
all these? And what are the <i>objects</i> upon which
Redemption is accomplished? Are they not <i>created</i>
objects? And what is the <i>effect</i> which redemption
has upon them? Is it not that of putting an end to
the disorders which sin has introduced, and bringing
them to their original glory? Is not the final result
of redemption to be that of bringing man back to that
state of holiness and rectitude which the work of creation
originally bestowed upon him? How then can
the praise of Redemption be celebrated, without celebrating
the praise of creation also? The one certainly
leads directly to the other. So that if Redemption
accomplish its proper fruits upon us, it will lead
us to be still more devout in observing the proper
memorial of the Creator's works.</p>

<p>But let it not be thought, because the work of creation
holds so prominent a place in our Sabbath meditations,
that redemption is therefore cast into the
shade. It is rather the contrary. For as those powers
by which we contemplate the work of creation,
<span class="pagenum">{2-39}</span>
and become acquainted with its grandeur and with its
author, are impaired by sin, so it is impossible for us
to enter into the subject profitably, except by the aid
which Redemption affords. If we attempt to bring
our mental powers to act upon the works of creation,
and to "look through nature up to Nature's God,"
we shall find them slow and lifeless to perform their
duty, until first purified and invigorated by the influence
of the great Atonement. Much, therefore, as it
is our duty to celebrate the praise of creation, we cannot
do so to the glory of God, without recognizing at
the same time the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
as the means by which we do it. From which it appears,
that the praises of creation and of redemption
go hand in hand in this matter. There is no clashing,&mdash;no
contrariety,&mdash;nor even such an elevation of one
above the other in respect to glory, that they cannot
be celebrated together, and upon the very day which
most fitly serves as the memorial of the former; which
memorial cannot be transferred to another day without
manifest incongruity.</p>

<p>It is manifest from the slightest consideration of the
nature and design of the Sabbatic institution, that
Redemption cannot be excluded from our meditations
on this holy day, but must hold a very prominent
place. For one great design of the Sabbath is, to
promote our conformity to holiness. But man partakes
of no holiness except through the gospel. The
mediation of Christ is the only channel through which
it is communicated to him, and this always in connection
with the most vigorous action of his mind on
the subject.</p>

<p>Another very important thing among the duties of
the Sabbath, is the cultivation of a right spirit with
reference to it. We should "<i>count it a delight</i>," Isa.
lviii.&nbsp;13. Can that man be called a Christian, who
<span class="pagenum">{2-40}</span>
counts it an irksome season? Is he spiritually minded
to whom it is an unwelcome interruption of his
worldly business, who in the avariciousness of his
heart says "when will the Sabbath be gone that we
may set forth wheat?" Amos. viii.&nbsp;5. Surely not.
His temper is any thing but in accordance with the
sacredness of the Sabbath season. His thoughts, his
feelings are a direct violation of that law which says,
"Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy." To
a real Christian, however, the Sabbath is the most delightful
season he enjoys on earth. It is something
like a heaven below; for the things of God and Christ
come then into direct contact with his holy soul. He
is as eager for the approach of this holy season, as a
child is for his holiday. Instead of it being too long
for him, it is too short; and with joy does he look
forward to a Sabbath which shall never end, that
which remaineth for the people of God, Heb. iv.&nbsp;9.
Such a spirit ought ever to be cultivated. In no other
way can the Sabbath become a means of grace to the
soul. What will mere abstinence from labor do? It
will only contribute to the renovation of the corporeal
system; which, it is true, is one design of the institution.
But this is a small part. Shall we take care
of the body, and not of the soul! Yet the soul suffers
unto death, if there be no care to cherish a right
spirit with reference to the day which is "the holy
of the Lord." Our very thoughts must be put under
restraint, and the greatest care taken that nothing of a
worldly nature intrude into the mind.</p>

<p>This leads us to observe, that our conversation
should have no reference to worldly things, but should
be upon such subjects as are spiritual and tend to the
furtherance of the soul in the divine life. "Not
speaking thine own words," Isa. lviii.&nbsp;13. But,
alas! we shall enter the dwellings of some, and when
<span class="pagenum">{2-41}</span>
the Sabbath approaches, we shall not know it by any
difference that we can discover in their conversation.
It is still upon subjects that have not the remotest connection
with the glory of God. Follow them to the
place of public worship, and up to the very threshhold
of the door, their speech still savors of this
world. Follow them through the whole of the day&mdash;the
state of their crops, the currency of the country,
the political aspect of things, banks, bonds, mortgages;
these are the themes upon which they expatiate.
These render them animated, and even eloquent.
"Out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh." Reader, thinkest thou that such
persons can say in truth, "O how I love thy law."
That law says, Remember the Sabbath-day to keep
it holy. Thinkest thou that the love of God reigns in
their hearts? This is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments. John. v.&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>All visiting for pleasure is inconsistent with a right
observance of the Sabbath. Express and plain is the
word of God&mdash;"Not finding thine own pleasure."
Isa. lxviii.&nbsp;13. Visiting the sick for the purpose of
alleviating their sufferings, and rendering what help
we can, either as it regards their bodies or their souls,
is not only allowable, but is a Sabbath duty. But
even this is liable to abuse. Multitudes take the Sabbath
to visit the sick, merely because they are not
willing to take time on any other day; and it is to be
feared that if there were no Sabbath, the sick would
be sadly neglected by them. Others go merely because
the rigid improvement of the day at home is
irksome to them. They watch the occasion, and
convert it as much as possible into a visit for their
own pleasure, while they quiet their consciences by
the reflection that they have been visiting the sick.
Reader! be careful how you seek to evade the restraints
<span class="pagenum">{2-42}</span>
of Heaven's law. Every attempt on your
part to convert the season of holy rest into a day of
pleasure, evinces a heart that counts the commandments
of God grievous. Is this a <i>renewed</i> heart?
Impossible. Remember, too, that while you visit
others for your own pleasure, you drive them to a
violation of the Sabbath, as well as yourself. You
take them from their closet, their reading, their
meditations.</p>

<p>All traveling, for business or for pleasure, is also
forbidden by the Sabbath law. Such traveling as
may be necessary in order to promote the due sanctification
of the day, is of course not included. Harnessing
our horses and riding to our accustomed places
of worship, may be necessary to promote the sanctification
of the Sabbath, and is, therefore, no breach
of it. It stands on the same level with the labor performed
by the priests of the Old Economy in the temple,
for which they were "blameless." Matt. xii.&nbsp;5.
Yet traveling one half the distance for pleasure, is a
profanation of the day, inasmuch as the word of God
says, "not finding thine own pleasure." For the
same reason, and because there are six days in
which men ought to work, journeying for business
on the Sabbath, is a violation of it. Take the following
case: Brother A. is out on a journey. The Sabbath
comes, and instead of putting up and resting until the
sacred season is past, he keeps right forward just as
he had done every other day of the week. True, he
professes to regret the necessity of traveling on this
day, but pleads in excuse that he cannot afford to stop
at a public house during the time. He is too poor;
or, he says, the tavern is a noisy, bustling place, and
unfavorable to his religious enjoyment, and, therefore,
he concludes it will be no greater violation of the
Sabbath to proceed quietly on his journey than it
would be to spend it in such a situation. But, brother,
<span class="pagenum">{2-43}</span>
let me talk with you about this. How much
would it cost you to stop at the public house? A
dollar, or two dollars; or it may be, if your family is
with you, five dollars. Well, will you barter away
the sanctity of the Sabbath for five dollars! Poor as
you are, will you make sale of the ordinance of God
for money? For this is what you do in reality. Turn
it and turn it whichever way you will, it comes at last
to this. Pause, then, and consider whether, under
such circumstances, and actuated by such principles,
you can class yourself with those who "esteem the
law of God better to them than thousands of gold and
silver." Ps. cxix.&nbsp;72. The true Christian would
rather impoverish himself to the last farthing than
violate one of God's precepts. "But the tavern was
noisy and bustling." How came you to put up at
such a tavern? Those who <i>remember</i> the Sabbath,
and are anxious to spend it to the glory of God, will
carefully look out and make their inquiries beforehand,
and in most cases will not have much difficulty
in lodging themselves at a quiet place. But if through
circumstances beyond their own control, they are
lodged in a place of different character, their duty is
to submit to it, and do the best they can. Your enjoyment
may not be so great; but what of that? Your
spiritual prosperity does not always depend on your
enjoyment; nor does God's glory depend upon it.
God's glory depends upon your obedience to his law,
and so does your prosperity. It is a mistaken notion
that Christians are never in the way of duty but when
they are in the way of enjoyment. Besides, dare you
prescribe terms to the Almighty, and say you will
obey him, provided he will grant you such enjoyments
and privileges as you want, otherwise you will
not? How daring the impiety! What if God lodged
you at such a wicked place on purpose that you
<span class="pagenum">{2-44}</span>
might, by your conduct and your words, be a reproof
to the ungodly sinners that frequented there. Will
you be ashamed of your duty, and shrink from the
trial? "He that is ashamed of me and of my words,
of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed." Luke ix.&nbsp;26.
Remember, my brother, God's law says, "Remember
the Sabbath to keep it holy." The exceptions
which you make, God has not made.</p>

<p>After what has been offered, it seems almost needless
to add, that Sabbath-keeping includes abstinence
from labor. The Divine law enjoins us "to keep it
holy." The plain meaning of which is, that it is a
day peculiarly sacred to the Lord. For the word
<i>holy</i>, when applied to things inanimate, or to portions
of time, denotes them to be set apart exclusively for
religious purposes. If, then, the day in question, according
to the divine mandate, is to be kept holy, it is
manifestly a sin to devote it, or any part of it, to secular
pursuits. Wherefore the law is express&mdash;"in it
thou shalt not do any work." All that work which
on other days is perfectly lawful, is on the holy Sabbath
to be laid aside, except such as may be absolutely
necessary for the prevention of distress, or the
relief of objects of mercy. But alas! what kind of
commentary upon this law is the conduct of many
who call themselves by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Let us see.&mdash;Neighbor B. has a large grass
farm, and milks daily from thirty to fifty cows. The
product of his dairy is cheese, of which he makes
one or perhaps two each day during the proper season.
The Sabbath comes, and the cows must be
milked. Well, that is right and necessary for the
prevention of distress. But then the milk must be
subjected to the same operation as on other days, and
the accustomed cheese must be made, because otherwise
it would be lost. Lost!&mdash;well, suppose it should
<span class="pagenum">{2-45}</span>
be, how much is it worth? Why, five dollars, more
or less. And so he barters away the sanctity of the
Sabbath for <i>five dollars</i>! Well, Judas sold his master
for thirty pieces of silver, and how much better is
your conduct than his? Or what better is your conduct
than mine would be in the following case? I
have a valuable horse, which I will sell for one hundred
dollars. A traveler passes my door on Sabbath
day, and offers me my price. Now the times are
hard, and by closing the bargain it will be a profit to
me of twenty or twenty-five dollars. By refusing to
do so, I lose the chance of selling him, and he remains
on my hands. Rather than lose so good an opportunity,
I strike the bargain, Sabbath though it be. Thus
have I sold the sanctity of the Sabbath for twenty
dollars! Neighbor B., who makes his cheese on the
Sabbath, is horror-struck, and comes over to admonish
me. But, "<i>Physician heal thyself</i>."</p>

<p>We might multiply cases to illustrate our argument,
but it is needless. Every instance of departure from
God's law, we believe, will be found to have originated
in selfishness. But that manner of keeping the
day which looks at our own interest, rather than the
honor of God, can in no way be called "keeping it
holy." For if it is holy, it is consecrated to the Lord,
not to ourselves. But in all the foregoing instances,
it is manifest, the individual looks first to himself.
Such selfishness is idolatry, and is the very spirit that
governs the carnal mind. But God, in the just retributions
of his providence, sometimes defeats the very
end proposed to be obtained by it. For instance, the
cheese, which is the product of Sabbath labor, spoils
on the dairyman's hands; or if that does not take
place, he fails of getting his pay for it. The farmer
who was in haste to gather in his hay or his grain on
the Sabbath for fear of a shower, has no sooner secured
<span class="pagenum">{2-46}</span>
it than the storm begins, and a single flash of
lightning consumes the whole. Or, it may be, when
winter comes, he takes it to market, trusts it out, and
finally gets nothing for it. The man who could not
afford the expense of stopping at the hotel over Sabbath
while on his journey, gets home, and finds perhaps
that on the very day he was profaning God's
holy institution, some person's cattle broke into his
grain-field and destroyed enough to pay for his lodging
at the hotel half a dozen times. What then did
he gain by it? That such retributions overtake those
who violate the law of God, is not merely imaginary.
On the contrary, it is believed, that were men more
close observers of the dealings of Providence, they
would be sensible that such things take place often.
But, alas! "God speaketh once, yea, twice, and man
perceiveth it not."</p>

<p>It seems almost superfluous to say any thing about
public worship, as an important part of Sabbath exercises.
If it were necessary to their spiritual prosperity
that Jews should meet together in "holy convocation,"
Lev. xxii.&nbsp;3, and be instructed in the testimonies
concerning a Messiah to come, it cannot be
less important that Christians should now assemble
and celebrate the fulfilment of those testimonies, and
"the grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ."
Our Lord has ordained public worship to be a means
of promoting the growth of his people in holiness;
and if the Sabbath is a means to the same end, they
ought both to go together, unless our situation render
it impossible. If on the holy Sabbath we cannot say,
"How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts,"
when can we? If on this holy day we cannot say,
"I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my
God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness," when
will it ever be the language of our hearts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{2-47}</span>
But we cannot enlarge. Our essay has already
exceeded the limits we had designed. We submit
the subject to your consideration, as being one of incalculable
importance. Reader, what course will you
take? God Almighty has separated one day in particular
from all others, and pronounced it holy. Will
you then say that all days are alike? Or will you
assume to yourself the prerogative of setting apart
whatever portion of time you choose, in open disregard
of that particular portion which God "sanctified
and blessed," saying, "it is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God?" Will you suffer your convenience or
your selfishness to come into conflict with the claims
of your Maker? Who is it that said, "If any man
will come after me, let him <span class="smcap">deny</span> himself?" Pause
then, before you suffer yourself to be lulled into indifference
on this matter. A vain sophistry insinuates
that it is a subject of minor importance&mdash;a <i>non-essential</i>.
But be not deceived. God has magnified
its importance throughout his holy oracles. It is God
the Lord that speaks, will you obey or will you turn
again to folly?</p>

"The Decalogue, as to the form of it, and as delivered

people (Israel), and was calculated for their use; though, as to
the matter of it, and so far as it is of a moral nature, and agrees

Christ inculcates only the precepts of the second table of the
law, not because they are of more importance than those of the
first, but because they are less easily counterfeited. Such duties
are by far too weighty to be permanently sustained by the hollow-heartedness
of the hypocrite.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_6" id="Foot_6" href="#Ref_6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most writers on this subject, though they admit the morality
of the Sabbath, and the claims it has upon all men indiscriminately,
appear to reason in a manner entirely different, when
they come to contend for a change from the seventh to the first
day of the week. Their arguments which before were predicated
upon the nature and fitness of things, and the requirements
of God, as the natural Lawgiver of mankind, are suddenly
changed and based upon the new dispensation of Jesus Christ.
Now this is an inconsistency; but it is one to which they are necessarily
driven, in order to give plausibility to the claims of
their new Sabbath. The fact that Christ introduced a new dispensation,
does not argue a change of the Sabbath, or an institution
of a new one, unless it can be proved that the old Sabbath
was a church ordinance. If it was, then, as there is a new
church state, of course we must look for new church ordinances.</p>

<p>How, then, will it be proved, that the old Sabbath was a
church ordinance? Will it be said that the observance of it was
indispensable to membership in the Jewish church? Very true.
But the same may be said of the laws concerning murder, and
theft, and adultery. Yet these were not, properly speaking,
church ordinances. Concerning these things men were bound,
though no church had ever existed. The sin of murder lay at
Cain's door, long before any church was formed. The earth was
corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence, before
the Jews were organized into a church; and the sin of dishonoring
his father blackened the character of Ham, long before the
fifth commandment was published from Sinai. So, too, the
Sabbath was set apart by God sanctifying it and blessing it, more
than two thousand years before it entered into the statute law of
Israel. It cannot, therefore, be a church ordinance.</p>

<p>Will it be said, that the Sabbath, though not altogether a
church ordinance, is nevertheless so in part? If this can be established,
then certainly so much of it as partook of this character
must necessarily have been abolished by the death of Christ,
and that part only remains which had no such character. But I
ask, what part of the Sabbath law can claim to be a church ordinance,
peculiar to the old dispensation. It will be said that the
particular day of the week set apart for observance, was such.
This, as all the world confesses, was the seventh in distinction
from every other. But the same rule which determines every
other part of the Sabbath law to be something else than a church
ordinance, determines the same thing with regard to the seventh
day of the week. If the Sabbath was not a church ordinance,
but obligatory upon all men indiscriminately, long before any
church existed, the same is true of the seventh day of the week.
One part of the law was not brought into existence without the
other, nor one part before the other. We conclude, therefore,
that the particular day which was consecrated, partook no more
of the nature of a church ordinance, than all the rest of the law
did.</p>

"The reason of positive institutions in general, is very obvious;
though we should not see the reason why such particular
ones are pitched upon, gather than others. Whoever, therefore,
instead of caviling at words, will attend to the thing itself, may
clearly see, that positive institutions in general, as distinguished
from this or that particular one, have the nature of moral commands,
since the reasons of them appear. Thus, for instance,
the <i>external</i> worship of God is a moral duty, though no particular
mode of it be so. Care then is to be taken, when a comparison
is made between moral and positive duties, that they be compared
no farther than as they are different&mdash;no farther than as
the former are positive, or arise out of mere external command,
the reasons of which we are not acquainted with; and as the
latter are moral, or arise out of the apparent reason of the case,
without such external command. Unless this caution be observed,
we shall run into endless confusion."&mdash;<i>Butler's Analogy of
Religion to Nature. Part II. Chap. 1.</i></p>

<p>It is very commonly said, that positive institutions are changeable,
and therefore are unlike moral precepts, which are unchangeable
and eternal in their nature. But we deny that positive
precepts are changeable, so long as the relation subsists in which
they originate. Such positive institutions as originated in the
peculiar relation which God sustained towards the Jews, by reason
of the Sinaitic covenant, remained unchanged and unchangeable
so long as that relation subsisted. Such as originate in the
relation He sustains towards man as his Redeemer through Jesus
Christ, also remain unchangeable so long as such relation remains.
On the same principle, such as originate in the natural
relation He bears to man as his Creator, remain just as long as
this relation exists; which is forever.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_8" id="Foot_8" href="#Ref_8">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
President Dwight observes, [Sermon 185,] "The distinction
between <i>moral</i> and <i>positive commands</i>, has been less clearly made
by moral writers than most other distinctions." He says the law
of the Sabbath is entirely of a moral nature, as to the whole end
to which it aims, so far as man is concerned; that "it makes no
difference here, whether we could have known it without information
from God, that one day in seven would be the best time
and furnish the best performance of these [religious] things, or
no. It is sufficient that we know them."</p>

<p>"The decalogue exhibits <i>a perfect standard of morality</i>; and a
standard of morality not providing for the public acknowledgement
and stated worship of God as the Creator, would be <i>essentially
defective</i>."&mdash;<i>Parkinson's Letters to Elder W. B. Maxson.</i></p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">THE SABBATH:</span><br /><span
          class="small">AUTHORITY FOR THE CHANGE OF THE DAY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It being clear from the Scriptures, that the seventh
day was instituted by divine authority for a weekly
Sabbath, and religiously regarded throughout the
times of the Old Testament, those who now relinquish
its observance, and keep the first day of the week,
take the ground that the Sabbath was either abrogated
and a new institution introduced in its room, or that
the time of its observance was changed from the
seventh to the first day of the week, in commemoration
of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
To be consistent with themselves, therefore, they are
bound to evince one or the other of these positions.
The burden of proof evidently lies on their part.
For unless it can be shown, that the fourth commandment,
which requires the sanctification of the seventh
day, has been abolished, or amended by the substitution
of the first for the seventh day of the week, it is
clear that the original appointment remains obligatory
and is now binding on the entire human family. And
to substantiate either of these points, the proof must
be clear and decisive. It will not do to rest upon
doubtful deductions. We have an unquestionable right
to demand that divine warrant, in either case, which
pertained to the institution as originally delivered.</p>

<p>We will therefore first examine the proofs adduced
in favor of the abrogation of the former weekly Sabbath
and the introduction of a new institution.</p>

<p class="gap-above">To sustain this position, the broad ground is taken
by some, that the Decalogue itself, in which the law
of the Sabbath is contained, was abrogated; and that,
<span class="pagenum">{3-2}</span>
under the new dispensation, no part of it is binding
but what is newly enjoined or expressly recognized,
either by Christ or his Apostles.</p>

<p>The perpetual obligation of the Decalogue implies,
of course, the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as
enjoined in the fourth commandment. But if <i>that</i>
was abrogated, the Sabbath which it enjoined was
also abrogated; and, consequently, it ceases to be
binding, unless renewed under the new economy.
What, then, is the proof here relied upon? One of
the principal passages in which this proof is supposed
to be contained is 2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:7, 8, 13. "But
if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel
could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the
glory of his countenance, which glory was to be
done away, how shall not the ministration of the
Spirit be rather glorious?... And not as Moses,
which put a veil over his face, that the children of
Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that
which is abolished." It is argued from this passage,
that the clauses "which glory was to be done away,"
and "to the end of that which is abolished," refer to
the whole law, <i>moral</i> as well as <i>ritual</i>, because mention
is made of "that which was written and engraven
in stones," which is an evident allusion to the Decalogue.
But, on careful examination, it will be found
that "that which was to be done away," was not the
<i>Decalogue itself</i>, but "the <i>ministration</i> of it," which
was then appointed&mdash;the same being emblematically
illustrated by the glory of Moses' countenance,
which was merely temporary. This clause refers
expressly to the glory of his countenance, and not to
the glory of the law itself. So also the clause "that
which is abolished," does not refer to the Decalogue,
but to the ministration of Moses, including the appended
rites and usages, the priesthood and its sacrifices,
<span class="pagenum">{3-3}</span>
which were useful merely for the time being.
It cannot be supposed that the Decalogue was abolished,
without expressly contradicting Christ's testimony,
Matt. 5:17-19, as well as many other
representations of the Scriptures. The abolishment
spoken of, therefore, evidently respected no other than
what the Apostle calls in another place "the law of
commandments contained in ordinances," inclusive of
the entire ministration of Moses. There is unquestionably
a reference in this chapter to the Decalogue,
but not as abolished. It was merely the ministration
of it, or the then instituted manner of teaching, illustrating,
and enforcing it, which was abolished, to be
succeeded by a new ministration of the same law by
the Spirit. For it is written, "I will put my law"&mdash;(the
very law of the ten commandments)&mdash;"in
their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."
Again, "We are not without law to God, but under
the law to Christ." What law but the Decalogue is
here referred to? Evidently none. For surely we
are not under the Mosaic ritual. Again, "Do we
make void the law through faith?... Yea, we establish
the law." The same, no doubt, which was
contained in the Decalogue. Hence, the Apostle
James says, "If ye fulfil the royal law according to
the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,
ye shall do well." Here the title "the royal law"
is given by way of eminence to the Decalogue; and its
permanent obligation is manifestly recognized; for the
precept alluded to is a summary of the last six commandments
of this code, and the allusion is so made
as to imply the continued obligation of the first four,
which are summed up in supreme love to God.
Again, the Apostle John testifies, "Hereby do we
know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
And again, "Blessed are they that do his
commandments, that they may have right to the tree
<span class="pagenum">{3-4}</span>
of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
city." In both these passages reference is evidently
had to the precepts of the Decalogue, as the essential
and permanent rule of obedience for Christians. The
doing away or abolishment, therefore, spoken of in
the above passage, cannot refer to the Decalogue or
the moral law <i>itself</i>, but to the Mosaic dispensation
or ritual.</p>

<p>Another of the proofs alledged for the abrogation of
the Decalogue, and consequently of the Sabbath, is
Colossians 2:14-17. "Blotting out the hand-writing
of ordinances that was against us, which was
contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
to his cross; and, having spoiled principalities and
powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing
over them in it. Let no man therefore judge you in
meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of
the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a
shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."</p>

<p>By "the hand-writing of ordinances," is most evidently
meant the ceremonial law&mdash;not the Decalogue,
or the moral law. This is never characterized as
"the hand-writing of ordinances." Therefore, the
"blotting out," "taking away," and "nailing to the
cross," spoken of, have no reference to this law, but
to the Mosaic ritual. This is particularly distinguished
from the Decalogue, and fitly described as "the
law of commandments contained in ordinances." It
was this, and this only, which was "blotted out" and
"nailed to the cross." As, therefore, the reference
made by the Apostle is expressly to this law, it follows,
by a fair inference, that "the sabbath days"
alluded to, or, strictly rendered, "sabbaths," are those
which were contained in this law, or among these
"ordinances," and do not include the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment. There were, besides the
weekly Sabbath, various other sabbaths appointed,
<span class="pagenum">{3-5}</span>
which belonged to that ritual, and not to the Decalogue.
Accordingly, these were expressly included
in "the hand-writing of ordinances," and like the rest
were "a shadow of things to come," and ceased to be
obligatory at the death of Christ. There is evidently
no authority in this passage for including any sabbaths
but what properly belonged to the Mosaic ritual.
This view of the matter is corroborated by a more
literal rendering of the 17th verse, viz: "Let no one
therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in a part
or division of a festival, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths."
The sabbaths alluded to are obviously those
which are found in the same place with meats and
drinks, festivals and new moons, and which were of
the same general character. The weekly Sabbath,
therefore, is not affected at all by their abrogation, but
remains in full force, as does every other precept of
the Decalogue.</p>

<p>We find the same distinction as to the law which
was abolished, in Ephesians 2:14, 15. "For he is
our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
down the middle wall of partition between us, having
abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
commandments contained in ordinances, for to make
in himself of twain one new man, so making peace."
Here the middle wall of partition between Jews and
Gentiles, called "the enmity," is expressly defined,
as before, to be "the law of commandments contained
in ordinances." This, and this only, therefore, was
abolished, leaving the Decalogue, or the moral law,
in its original character and obligation. This is the
language of the whole Bible. There is no proof in
any of these passages, that the law of the ten commandments
was abolished, or that the Sabbath enjoined
therein was done away.</p>

<p>Nor is there such proof in Romans 14:5, 6.
"One man esteemeth one day above another; another
<span class="pagenum">{3-6}</span>
esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the
day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth
not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He
that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God
thanks: and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth
not, and giveth God thanks." This passage is frequently
adduced as proof that the obligation to keep
the ancient Sabbath has ceased, and that under the
Gospel dispensation there is no divinely authorized
distinction in the days of the week; that there is no
one constituted <i>holy</i> in distinction from the <i>rest</i>; and
consequently that every one is left at his own liberty
to keep a Sabbath or not. It will be easily perceived,
that if this argument has any weight in reference to
the <i>seventh</i> day as the Sabbath, it operates equally
against the obligation to keep the <i>first</i> day, either as
a substitute for the seventh, or as a memorial of the
resurrection, seeing it places all distinctions whatever
as to days on the same ground with the confessedly
obsolete rites of the Mosaic ritual. According to this
view of the passage, we have under the Gospel dispensation
<i>no Sabbath at all</i>&mdash;not so much as an <i>authorized</i>
memorial of the resurrection. He who
claims the least authority for the observance of the
<i>first</i> day of the week for <i>any</i> purpose, takes a course
which completely overthrows the argument based
upon this passage. But, in reality, this text has nothing
more to do with the subject before us, than
either of those which have been examined. It respects
merely the distinctions which formerly existed
in regard to the six working days of the week&mdash;some
of them being appointed in the Mosaic ritual as sabbaths,
others as days of atonement and purification,
and others as festivals. Some of the early Christians
thought these distinctions still binding, as also the distinctions
in regard to meats and drinks; others thought
<span class="pagenum">{3-7}</span>
they were not. Hence the exhortation which is subjoined
to mutual forbearance. That the distinctions
referred to as to days, were those noted in the Mosaic
ritual, and did not include the one contained in the
fourth commandment, is manifest from the whole
scope of the chapter. There is particular reference
made to one's freely eating all things, while another
would eat only herbs; and accordingly the following
rule, to be respectively observed, is laid down: "Let
not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and
let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth; for
God hath received him." This quotation clearly
evinces that the Apostle was treating of <i>ritual</i> distinctions,
and not of <i>that</i> distinction of days which
was constituted by the ancient law of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Again, the abrogation of the Decalogue is supposed
to be taught in Romans 7:4, 5, 6. "Wherefore,
my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another,
even to him who is raised from the dead, that
we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we
were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by
the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit
unto death. But now we are delivered from the law,
that being dead wherein we were held; that we
should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness
of the letter." But if the term law here includes
the <i>moral</i> as well as the <i>ceremonial</i> law, it is
manifest that believers are not said to be delivered
from it, considered in any other light than as <i>a covenant
of works</i>. Certainly they are not delivered from
it as <i>a rule of obedience</i>. To suppose this, is inconsistent
with Christ's sermon on the mount, before
alluded to, and many other decisive proofs of the perpetual
obligation of the Decalogue. It is probable
the Apostle had special reference to the deliverance
of believers from the <i>curse</i> of the moral law. This
<span class="pagenum">{3-8}</span>
is reasonably inferred from the clause, "that being
dead wherein we were held." If any thing more
pertaining to this law be intended, it must be its original
character when given to Adam as a covenant of
works or of life. For surely we are not and cannot
be delivered from it as a rule of obedience, so long as
God is what he is, and we are what we are. Seeing
that as long as the relation constituted by his character
as Supreme Ruler, and by ours as moral subjects,
exists, we shall be bound to love him supremely, and
our neighbor as ourselves, which is the fulfilling of
this law. And to suppose that this law, as a rule of
obedience, was actually annulled, and that those precepts
only are now to be considered obligatory, which
are enacted or published anew under the Gospel, is
to suppose that God, at a certain time, actually rescinded
the rule requiring supreme love to him, and
to our neighbor as ourselves, which is palpably inconsistent,
and contrary both to the current of Scripture
and the nature of things. It would be maintaining
that to be changed which is manifestly unchangeable.
It would imply that, for the time being, the obligation
recognized by the law did not exist; that the tie by
which God and moral beings are united, was sundered,
not by rebellion on the part of his subjects, but by his
own act of abrogation. Can this be admitted?</p>

<p>But if it <i>were</i> admissible, and if no part of this
law is binding on Christians but what is newly
enacted or particularly recognized under the Gospel
dispensation, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment
could not in this way be set aside; because its continued
obligation is plainly taught in the New Testament.
It is altogether a mistake, that we have no
express recognition of this precept under the Christian
dispensation. It is plainly recognized by the Savior
in Matthew 5:17-19, where he says, that he "came
not to destroy the law, but to fulfill;" that "one
<span class="pagenum">{3-9}</span>
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
till all be fulfilled;" and that "whosoever shall break
one of these least commandments, and shall teach
men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them,
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." If
any commandment of this law is binding, the fourth
is binding of course, even if it should be called the
least. It is also recognized in the following declaration
of Christ, Mark 2:27&mdash;"The Sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the Sabbath." The word
<i>man</i> is here obviously used for the entire race&mdash;not
for a part&mdash;not for the Jews in distinction from the
Gentiles&mdash;not for those who lived under the Old
Testament dispensation, or till the time of Christ's
death; but for man in his protracted existence during
all future periods of time, i. e. <i>for mankind in general</i>.
This is the plain import of the declaration. And if
we render the original with the article, it is still more
evident that the entire race is included. "The Sabbath
was made for <i>the man</i>," i. e. for Adam, the original
parent of man, including, of course, his posterity.
But, according to either rendering, the entire
human race is manifestly included in the term. The
Sabbath, then, was as truly made for the Gentiles as
for the Jews; and for those who should live after the
crucifixion, as for those who lived before; which is an
explicit recognition of its perpetual obligation.</p>

<p>The same recognition also appears from its continued
observance under the ministry of the Apostles, and
there being not the least hint or stir in reference to
its abrogation, or to the substitution of another day in
its room. The weekly Sabbath is frequently mentioned
in the Apostolic records, as a part of practical
duty, and it was unquestionably the seventh day.
Thus we have the continued obligation of the Sabbath
sanctioned by Apostolic example. If, therefore, a
<span class="pagenum">{3-10}</span>
new edition, or an express recognition of the Sabbath
of the fourth commandment be considered necessary,
to bind the consciences of men under the new dispensation,
the foregoing considerations will show that
we have such an edition or recognition, as truly as
we have of the other precepts of the Decalogue. So
that nothing is gained in regard to setting aside the
seventh day of the week, by attempting to show the
abrogation of the Decalogue. If those precepts of
that law which require that we should have no other
gods before the Lord&mdash;that we should not kill, nor
commit adultery, nor steal&mdash;are newly enjoined or
expressly recognized under the present dispensation,
and, consequently, universally binding, the same is
true of the fourth commandment, which requires the
keeping of the seventh day.</p>

<p>Again, an attempt is made to prove the abrogation
of the original Sabbath, by showing that the entire
Decalogue was peculiar to the Jewish nation, constituting
a national covenant, which, at the coming of
Christ, was annulled, and a new covenant introduced.
But admitting that it was delivered immediately to
them, in the form of a national covenant, this does not
in the least imply that it was not equally binding, as
a rule of obedience, upon other portions of the human
family. We might as well argue that the New
Testament belonged merely to the primitive Christians,
because it was delivered directly to them, and
constituted the rule of their conduct and the basis
of their hopes. Yea, we might as well suppose that
no nation except the Jews were bound not to have
any other gods before the Lord, not to kill, not to
commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness,
as to suppose that the Decalogue was purely of
a national character, and binding merely on that people
during their continuance as a national church.
And, as the Decalogue was not merely national <i>as a
<span class="pagenum">{3-11}</span>
whole</i>, so there was nothing national in the fourth
commandment. It belonged, equally with the other
nine, to the entire family of man, inasmuch as the
essential reasons of all and of either of the commandments,
were of universal obligation.</p>

<p>Again, that the original Sabbath was peculiar to
the Jews, and consequently abrogated by the introduction
of the new dispensation, is argued from its
being specially urged upon them by the consideration
of their deliverance from Egypt. But this argument
is of no force, because the same reason is urged in the
preface to the entire Decalogue.</p>

<p>For the same purpose, also, an argument is founded
upon the fact that the fourth commandment was enforced
with a deadly penalty. But this argument also
fails; because a similar penalty was annexed to the
breach of the other precepts of this law. The truth
of the case is, that these penalties belonged not to
the Decalogue itself as first promulgated, any more
than they belong to it now under the milder dispensation
of the Gospel. They were added in the Mosaic
ritual, and constituted a part of the political arrangements
for the time being. Their abrogation, therefore,
affects not the original law. Though there be
no civil power now given to the church to enforce
obedience to this precept by temporal punishments, as
formerly, the sacredness and obligation of the institution
are not thereby at all affected. The sin of disobedience
will be visited in God's own time.</p>

<p>Again, some have inferred the abrogation of the
former Sabbath, or at least its change, from our Lord's
vindication of the act of the disciples, in plucking the
ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands, as they
passed through the corn-fields on the Sabbath day,
and from his saying, that "the Son of Man is Lord
also of the Sabbath day," Mark 2:23-28. But
there is evidently nothing in this narrative, or in this
<span class="pagenum">{3-12}</span>
declaration, to justify such an inference. It must be
admitted on all hands, that the fourth commandment
was obligatory, as originally given, till the death of
Christ, if no further; and therefore Christ, who
"was made under the law," was bound to obey it in
its original strictness. Admitting that he possessed
the right, in a given instance, to intermit its obligation,
it is not consistent to maintain that he did it; because
he came to render perfect and universal obedience.
Hence he affirmed, that one jot or one tittle should
in no wise pass from the law "till all be fulfilled."
His whole life was a perfect comment on the requirements
of the law. Had he failed in the least particular,
he would have been inadequate to the great purposes
of our salvation. It is obvious, therefore, that
the transaction alluded to was not, under the circumstances,
a breach of the fourth commandment, but in
perfect accordance with its prescriptions&mdash;the labor
implied by the act of the disciples being a matter of
urgent necessity. "It is lawful," said he, "to do
well on the Sabbath day." Neither does the declaration,
that "the Son of Man is Lord also of the
Sabbath day," imply that he abrogated or changed it,
but rather that he was bound and engaged to protect
it as a divine institution, and to enforce an enlightened
and strict obedience to its requirements.</p>

<p>The foregoing being the principal proofs adduced
for the abrogation of the Decalogue, and the original
Sabbath, it is evident that this view of the subject
cannot be sustained. It is not sanctioned by any plain
scriptural evidence. It is, therefore, palpably absurd
to rest so important a matter upon so slender a basis.
It is laying violent hands on a code of moral and immutable
precepts, given by God, and promulgated
under peculiar and terrible signs of purity and majesty,
to vindicate a practice which was introduced long
after the commencement of the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{3-13}</span>
Another portion of the observers of the first day,
seeing the absurdity of holding to the abrogation of
the Decalogue, and, consequently, of the Sabbath of
the fourth commandment, readily admit its perpetual
obligation, but alledge that the Sabbath is changed,
under the new dispensation, from the <i>seventh</i> to the
<i>first</i> day of the week&mdash;thus transferring the authority
for keeping the seventh day to the first. It is not
pretended that we have an explicit warrant from God,
pointing out and authorizing the change in question,
but that we have what is tantamount to such a warrant.
We will examine the principal arguments for
this supposed change.</p>

<p>In the first place, this change is inferred from the
resurrection of Christ on the first day of the week,
which is supposed to be an event of such magnitude
as to constitute an <i>equal</i> and even <i>greater</i> reason for
observing the first day of the week as the weekly
Sabbath under the new dispensation, than that which
existed for observing the seventh under the old.
But what does this argument amount to? It is not
perfectly clear that the resurrection occurred on the
first day of the week. Very plausible reasons may
be assigned for the opinion, that it occurred on the
evening of the seventh day, although it was not publicly
declared till the morning of the first. But admitting
that it occurred on the morning of the first
day, how does this prove that it was substituted for
the seventh day as the Sabbath? Is the inference
absolutely necessary? Is there any designation of
the first day for a sabbatic purpose? If another than
the seventh day was in any wise admissible, as according
better with the Christian dispensation and the
work of redemption, why should we fix upon the day
of Christ's resurrection, rather than the day of his
birth, or of his crucifixion, or of his ascension? Will
it be alledged, as a reason for the preference, that he
<span class="pagenum">{3-14}</span>
finished the work of redemption on the day of his
resurrection? This reason might be offered with
equal if not superior propriety, for commemorating the
day of his crucifixion; because, when he bowed his
head and gave up the ghost; he said, "<i>It is finished</i>,"
which is more than is said in reference to the day of
his resurrection. If a day were to be selected as a
weekly Sabbath, which was "validly the day of redemption,"
it seems most proper to select the day of
his death, which was the end of his temptation and
conflict with the powers of darkness, and the severest
test of his obedience; or the day of his final ascension,
when he emphatically entered into his rest, and
was crowned King in Zion. If, therefore, a day were
to be selected, under the new economy, for the appropriate
commemoration of the work of redemption,
as the seventh day was for the commemoration of the
work of creation, it is by no means clear that it should
be the day of the resurrection. It might with equal,
perhaps greater propriety, be some other day of the
week. And hence, the different preferences of Christians
might clash, and by that means counteract in a
great measure the design of a Sabbath. But, in truth,
the argument from the resurrection in favor of the
first day of the week, rests upon the wisdom of man
and not upon the appointment of God. It seems to
men befitting the ends of a weekly Sabbath, under
the Christian dispensation, to observe the first rather
than the seventh day, and hence a change is inferred,
without any express authority from God to that effect;
as though it were lawful to change a divine
institution when it <i>appears to us</i> that greater reasons
exist for a change, than for its unamended continuance&mdash;a
principle which would justify all the innovations
and extravagancies of Popery. But no such
power is given unto men. However many and important
the reasons which exist in human view for
<span class="pagenum">{3-15}</span>
the change in the Sabbath contended for, it is invading
God's prerogative to make a change without his express
warrant. So long, therefore, as there is no divine
enactment which goes to authorize this change, but
the permanent and unvaried nature of the entire
Decalogue expressly forbids it, as does the continued
practice of the primitive church, it is grossly erroneous
and presumptuous to make it. This argument for the
supposed change is surely without any validity.</p>

<p>In the next place, it is alledged that Christ's appearance
to the disciples, after his resurrection, on
the first day of the week, marks this as the Christian
Sabbath. This argument is adopted both by those
who hold to the abrogation of the former institution,
and those who contend for its change. But, in
reality, it is as devoid of solid weight as the one previously
examined. It is easy to account for his appearing
in the course of the day of his resurrection,
or of the first declaration of it, because the earliest
information of this great event was of the utmost
importance to the afflicted and desponding disciples.
It was important, also, as a testimony to the truth of
the Savior's prediction that he would rise on the
third day. There is nothing in his several appearances
during that day, which seems intended for any
other purpose than giving the necessary proof of his
resurrection, and the light and consolation which the
circumstances of the disciples required. There is
nothing in either of them which favors the idea of a
new Sabbath. But the circumstance of his appearing
to the two disciples who were on a journey to Emmaus,
and traveling a while with them, which was a
distance much too long for a Sabbath day's journey,
expressly forbids it, as it shows that it was regarded
as a day for labor. And as to his appearance the following
evening, there is nothing in that circumstance
which savors of a newly appointed Sabbath. The
<span class="pagenum">{3-16}</span>
disciples were not assembled together to keep a Sabbath,
but "for fear of the Jews." Besides, according
to the Jewish method of reckoning time, this
evening actually belonged to the second day of the
week. So that all which is said concerning his appearances
on this day and evening, is perfectly devoid
of proof of a change of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>As to the next appearance recorded, there is no
evidence that it occurred on the first day of the week.
The record states, that "After eight days, again his
disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then
came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the
midst, and said, Peace be unto you." Surely the
phrase, "and after eight days," cannot be fairly construed
to mean a week. Who can tell but that he
appeared on the <i>ninth</i> day after his first appearance?
But even if it could be so interpreted as to mean precisely
a week, and hence to show that his second appearance
took place on the first day, as before, it would
be no proof of the point in question, because the
subject of the Sabbath was not introduced in any
form.</p>

<p>The next instance of his appearing is very far from
corroborating the opinion that he sanctioned the first
day as the New Testament Sabbath by appearing on
it; for the disciples, or some of them, were fishing
at the sea of Tiberias, and consequently were not
observing the first day as a Sabbath. Indeed, this
appearance must have taken place as late as the
second day of the week, if not later; for they had
been engaged in fishing, as the record will show, the
day before he appeared to them. And they could not
have been so engaged on the <i>seventh</i> day, because it
would have been contrary to the universal and unbroken
practice of their nation. Hence it could not
have been on the first day of the week that Christ
appeared to them. It must have been on the second
<span class="pagenum">{3-17}</span>
or some later day of the week. The argument, therefore,
from the several appearances of Christ, amounts
to nothing.</p>

<p>The next, and the principal argument for the
change of the Sabbath, is the supposed Apostolic
practice of meeting on the first day of the week for
public worship and the breaking of bread. It is often
confidently affirmed, that the keeping of the first day
instead of the seventh is sanctioned by Apostolic
usage. The proof of this position rests mainly on
two passages. Let us examine them.</p>

<p>The first is Acts 20:7. "And upon the first day
of the week, when the disciples came together to
break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
on the morrow, and continued his speech until
midnight." But is there any thing in this transaction,
or the attendant circumstances, which clearly and undeniably
proves an Apostolic example in favor of a
new Sabbath, or of keeping the first day of the week,
in any manner, as a substitute for the former institution?
Surely there is not. The passage does not so
much as prove that the practice of meeting for worship
on the first day of the week was then common
and general. But if it did, it would not determine
the change contended for. There is nothing said in
the narrative, which characterizes it as a Sabbath.
Assembling for public worship is proper on any day
of the week; and so is the breaking of bread. The
Supper was first administered on one of the six working
days; and there is nothing in the Scriptures which
restricts its subsequent administration to a particular
day&mdash;not even to the authorized Sabbath. Besides,
in this case, the breaking of bread was deferred till
after midnight. Of course, according to the Jewish
reckoning of time, it was attended actually on the
second day; and this must have been the case, also,
according to the prevailing custom among observers
<span class="pagenum">{3-18}</span>
of the first day, of commencing the day at midnight.
It seems, therefore, that the Apostle and his brethren
were not very precise in regard to its being done on
the first day. Let the most be made of this passage,
and it lacks a divine designation of the first day as
the Christian Sabbath; and hence it is entirely wanting
as to the requisite evidence of a change in the
sabbatic law. Surely, if there had been such a
change, and this, with one more instance of meeting
on the first day of the week, were to contain the evidence
for all after generations, we should have been
informed of the fact. Something would have been
said to determine that the first day of the week was
regarded as a Sabbath, and that it had taken the place
of the seventh. But there is nothing of this. The
record is perfectly silent in regard to either point.
Besides, it is evident that the original Sabbath continued
to be observed, as already noticed, throughout
the entire period of New Testament history. This
is so plain a fact, that no one who gives the subject
a candid examination will deny it. This shows the
opinion of a new Sabbath&mdash;observed, as it must have
been, in connection with the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment, and without a word being said on the
subject, or the least objection, stir, query, or excitement
whatever being raised&mdash;to be perfectly preposterous.
Such is the result of this reasoning from a
supposed Apostolic example, giving the passage its
widest possible scope, as implying a common practice
of meeting for public worship on the first day of the
week. But in reality there is nothing in this text
which proves or implies that such a practice was
common at that period. For aught appears, it might
have been an occasional meeting, appointed merely
in consequence of Paul's being about to depart on the
morrow. Therefore, to adopt a practice so important
as the one in question, upon such vague, uncertain,
<span class="pagenum">{3-19}</span>
and inadequate testimony&mdash;especially when, in order
thereto, we must dispose of a plain and positive command
of God respecting the observance of the seventh
day, and of a usage as old as the completion of the
creation&mdash;is unreasonable in the extreme.</p>

<p>Another passage quoted in proof of an Apostolic
example of keeping the first day of the week, and,
consequently, in support of the opinion that the Sabbath
is changed, is 1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:2. "Upon
the first day of the week let every one of you lay by
him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there
be no gatherings when I come." This passage, like
the others, does not imply that the first day was then
commonly and generally regarded as a day for public
worship. Indeed, it does not necessarily imply a
public meeting of any kind. The direction for "every
one to lay by him in store," for the benefit of the poor
saints at Jerusalem, "on the first day of the week,"
necessarily amounts to no more than an appointment of
this day to make up their bounty <i>at home</i>, so that it
might be sure to be ready when the Apostle should
come&mdash;a very judicious arrangement, as the time of
his coming for it was uncertain, and he would not
know how to wait. But if it be understood to imply
anything more, it is simply that they should bring
their donations together publicly on the first day of
the week, so as to be prepared in the fullest sense for
the Apostle's visit. Therefore, according to this view
of the case, it proves no more than an occasional
meeting on this day for the purpose of a public contribution
for an important object of benevolence. But
even if it could be so construed as clearly to imply
that it was then a common and general practice to
meet for public worship and instruction on this day,
it would not thereby be pointed out to us as the
Christian Sabbath, and a substitute for the seventh
day, seeing that it contains no information to that effect,
<span class="pagenum">{3-20}</span>
and that no divine warrant appears on any part
of the New Testament records for the supposed
change. Meetings for public worship, taking up of
collections, and even breaking of bread, do not constitute
a Sabbath, though they are proper exercises
for such a day. <i>To sabbatize</i> is to rest from our own
secular labors, and keep a season holy to God. These
proofs for a change of the Sabbath, therefore, which
are unquestionably the best that can be produced, are
utterly deficient, and the argument therefrom, as
generally presented, is deceptive, and unworthy of
confidence.</p>

<p>Another of the proofs adduced for the supposed
change of the Sabbath, is the following prediction.
Psalm 118:22-24. "The stone which the builders
refused is become the head stone of the corner.
This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our
eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made;
we will rejoice and be glad in it." But this, like all
the previous quotations, wants solidity. The main
points in the argument are <i>assumed</i>. First, it is assumed,
that Christ's becoming the head of the corner
refers to the day of his resurrection; whereas there
is no conclusive evidence that it refers to this rather
than to the day of his birth, or of his entrance on his
public ministry, or of his final ascension into heaven.
Next, it is assumed that the day spoken of is a natural
day of twenty-four hours; whereas this word is often
used to designate an indefinite period of time&mdash;particularly
the Gospel era (John 8:56)&mdash;and may very
probably be so used here. Again, it is assumed, that
the day mentioned is the first day of the week;
whereas there is nothing which designates this rather
than some other in the course of his mediatorial work,
allowing a natural day to be referred to. And even
if the resurrection day be intended, it is not certain
that this occurred on the first day of the week. It is
<span class="pagenum">{3-21}</span>
further assumed, that the emphasis which is laid on
the day alluded to as "the day which the Lord hath
made," and in which the church would "rejoice and
be glad," determines it to be the New Testament
Sabbath in distinction from the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment; whereas there is nothing in these circumstances
which necessarily intimates any such
change, while there are various important considerations
by which this opinion is absolutely precluded.
The entire argument, therefore, fails.</p>

<p>Another argument for the change of the Sabbath
is based upon the supposition that the day of Pentecost
occurred on the first day of the week, which was
a remarkable season of the outpouring of the Spirit,
and of Christ's triumph as the risen and exalted Savior.
But this will appear, on a very little examination,
to be wholly inconclusive. In the first place, it
is far from being conclusively proved that this event
occurred on the first day of the week. It is much
more likely to have occurred either on the <i>fifth</i> or the
<i>seventh</i>. Indeed, it is quite manifest from the best
calculations that can be made, from the time of eating
the passover supper, the first paschal sabbath, the
crucifixion and the resurrection, that it occurred on
one or the other of these days. Secondly, if the
feast of Pentecost had actually occurred on the first
day of the week, this would furnish no proof of its
being the New Testament Sabbath, in the absence of
a divine warrant to that effect.</p>

<p>There is one other argument for the change in question,
founded on the supposed application of the title
"the Lord's day," to the first day of the week. The
only passage referred to for the purpose of sustaining
it, is Revelation 1:10. "I was in the spirit on the
Lord's day." But that the day here called the Lord's
day, is the first day of the week, is merely assumed,
and hence is not to be considered as proved. It is
<span class="pagenum">{3-22}</span>
not, in fact, <i>probable</i> that this is the day referred to.
It is much more likely that the expression here used
refers to the day of Christ's reign; and that St. John
meant to declare that in spirit he had a view of the
scenes of that period. This use of the term <i>day</i> is
sanctioned by the Savior's declaration, "Abraham
rejoiced to see my day," (John 8:56,) as well as by
the Psalmist's, who, when speaking of the glories
of Christ's kingdom, says, "This is the day which
the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in
it," (Psalm 118:23.) The nature of the visions
afterwards described also corroborates this view of
the passage, and warrants the opinion that the expression
"Lord's day," (or, as some translate it,
<i>lordly</i> day,) here used, does not refer to a natural day,
but to a longer period of time. If, however, these
words be understood to refer to a natural day, it is
more likely to be the seventh day, which God had
blessed and sanctified for his special service, than the
first day. The seventh day is called by Him "<i>my
holy day</i>," and "<i>the holy of the Lord</i>"&mdash;phrases very
similar to the one in this passage. This was also the
Sabbath which was made for man, and of which
Christ says he is Lord. And since it was observed
up to the close of the New Testament history, it
would be perfectly natural for John to speak of it as
"the Lord's day." Further, there is no evidence
that the first day of the week was denominated the
Lord's day, at so early a period. Only one writer
mentions the expression till towards the close of the
second century; and the reputed author of this passage,
when speaking, in his Gospel, (which was written
some years later than the Apocalypse,) of the
resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week;
never intimates that the day should be called by any
other name. The learned Morer, though an advocate
for the first day, in mentioning the different days
<span class="pagenum">{3-23}</span>
to which this phrase may be applied, acknowledges
the entire uncertainty as to what day is intended,
and says, "It is very likely that the more solemn and
public use of the words was not observed until about
the time of Sylvester II., when, by Constantine's
command, it became an injunction." It is evident,
therefore, that this passage cannot justly be used as
proof that the Sabbath had been transferred to the
first day of the week.</p>

<p class="gap-above">We have now examined the proofs commonly adduced
for the abrogation or change of the original
Sabbath, and have found them utterly insufficient and
deceptive. Hence the claims of the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment, without alteration, are fully
sustained. The advocates for the first day are aware
that if an abrogation or change of the original Sabbath
law cannot be made out, the seventh day is still
the true Sabbath. Dr. Dwight, for instance, makes
the following admission: "If we cannot find in the
Scriptures plain and ample proof of the abrogation
of the original day, or the substitution of a new one,
the seventh day undoubtedly remains in full force and
obligation, and is now to be celebrated by all the race
of Adam." Here, then, the laboring oar is confessedly
put into the hands of the advocates of the first
day; and with what success they have used it, the
foregoing examination will show. We ask, is it not
a total failure? Has such "plain and ample proof"
been produced from the Scriptures for the supposed
abrogation or change? Indeed, it is evident that
neither one nor the other of these things is <i>practicable</i>.
An <i>abrogation</i> is not practicable; for the Decalogue,
in which the law of the Sabbath is contained,
is unchangeable. "Not one jot or one tittle shall in
any wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled;"
which implies its continued obligation, as long as
<span class="pagenum">{3-24}</span>
moral beings exist. And the <i>change</i> contended for is
not practicable; because the substitution of another
day for the seventh would annul the institution.
It contains no warrant to keep the first day of the
week as a Sabbath, but the seventh only. Its authority
is limited to the seventh day, and cannot be
transferred. The reason given for its institution, likewise,
is limited to this day. It is obvious that it will
not apply to another. The Sabbath law, therefore,
contains no warrant whatever for the observance of
the first day of the week. If the day is changed, the
institution is annulled; and another institution, in
some respects similar, but not in all, is introduced, in
the total absence of <i>divine</i> authority, and hence rests
altogether upon that which is <i>human</i>. This consideration,
of itself, shows the absurdity of holding to the
change of the original day, while the validity of the
entire Decalogue is admitted.</p>

<p>From what has been here presented, it is evident
that the Scriptures do not authorize the abrogation or
change of the original Sabbath, but enforce its observance
by precept and example. The opposite
view is supported wholly by tradition and human
authority, as an impartial examination of the history
of the change will show. Have we not a right to
expect, then, that when the great body of professing
Christians shall become enlightened on this subject,
and have sufficient grace and fortitude to act up to
their convictions, the result will be, a general return
to the faithful keeping of the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment?</p>

<p>HISTORY OF THE SABBATH.</p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding numbers of this series of Tracts, we
have given an account of the institution of the Sabbath,
and the reasons for believing it to be moral and perpetually
binding, together with an examination of the
authority for a change of the day. As the result of
this examination, we have been driven to the conclusion,
that the Sabbath was given to man in Paradise; that
the fourth commandment was but a reënforcement of
it; that the Scriptures do not authorize a change of
the day of the Sabbath; and that, therefore, <i>the seventh
day of the week ought now to be observed by all
men</i>. But there are many persons who admit the
early institution of the Sabbath, and the absence of any
authority from the Scriptures for a change, yet suppose
that the example of the early Christians, and the
sayings of "the Fathers," warrant them in observing
the first day of the week, to the neglect of the seventh.
For the benefit of such, we now come to consider the
history of the Sabbath since the establishment of the
Christian Church. By consenting to do this, it is not
meant to admit, that if a regard for the first day of the
week can be traced to near the time of the Apostles,
<span class="pagenum">{4-4}</span>
it is necessarily of apostolic authority; for it is affirmed
by St. Paul, that even in his time "the mystery of
iniquity had begun to work." We believe that "the
Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation,
so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor
may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any
man;" and we cannot admit, therefore, that the early
existence of the practice is sufficient to give it divine
authority, unless sanctioned by the inspired writings.
In order to establish the claims of the first day of the
week to be the Sabbath, two things are indispensable:
1. To prove from the Scriptures that the seventh day
(which all acknowledge to have been originally the
Sabbath) has been abrogated. 2. To show from the
same source that the first day has been appointed in the
place of the seventh. It is not sufficient to prove that
a religious regard was early paid to the first day. There
is an important distinction between <i>the Sabbath</i> and a
<i>religious festival</i>; the former requiring abstinence
from all ordinary labor, and devotion of a whole day to
the public and private duties of religion; the latter
requiring only the commemoration of some important
event, and allowing the time not occupied in the public
celebration of it to be devoted to labor or amusement.
That this distinction was understood to exist between
the regard for the seventh day and that for the first day,
seems evident from the fact that in the early history of
the church no Christians are charged with abandoning
the Sabbath, while we are assured that after the meetings
on the first day of the week they went about their
ordinary labor. This apparently innocent regard for
the day on which Christ first appeared to his disciples
after his resurrection, it is believed, has given rise to
the whole apostacy from the Sabbath. The following
pages are designed to show the steps by which it
was brought about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-5}</span></p>

<h3 class="small">The Sabbath in the Apostolic Church.</h3>

<p>Before entering upon the history of the Sabbath, as
it is derived from uninspired records, it is proper
to inquire how it was regarded by Jesus Christ and
his Apostles.</p>

<p>That Jesus Christ embraced the observance of the
Sabbath among other duties enjoined in the Decalogue,
is evident from Matt. 5:17:&mdash;"Think not that I am
come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfill; for verily I say unto
you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
He here declared the precepts of this law, without
distinction, to be permanent and unchangeable. Had
he commanded his disciples to keep the Sabbath, by
enacting a new precept, it would have been equivalent
to saying that he considered it in the light of a ceremonial
and expiring institution, which, in truth, it was
not. He therefore most wisely enforced all those precepts
as inseparable, unchangeable, and unrepealable.
And he plainly said, in the connection referred to, that
no person is worthy of a place in his church, who will
break any one of these commandments, or teach others
to do so. In all his subsequent allusions to this subject,
he speaks of the Sabbath as an ancient and well-established
ordinance, founded in the nature and fitness
of things, made for and adapted to the uses of mankind.
(Mark 2:27.) His <i>example</i> was in strict conformity
with his teachings on this subject. His "<i>custom</i>"
was to go to places of public worship, and to
preach the Gospel on the Sabbath. His <i>disciples</i>, being
educated in the observance of the Sabbath, could
have entertained no doubts as to its perpetuity, nor
have reasons to suppose that Christianity relaxed their
obligation to observe it. It is very certain, that during
<span class="pagenum">{4-6}</span>
the whole time that our Lord was with his disciples
before his death, he gave no intimation to them that
the duty of keeping the Sabbath was to be in any wise
affected by his death; and we find that after this event,
the disciples "rested the Sabbath day, according to the
commandment." (Luke 23:56.) Further, our Saviour
himself, when speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem,
an event not to take place until forty years after
his death, tells his disciples to pray that their flight
might not be on the Sabbath day. It is difficult to
conceive why this day should be spoken of at so late
a period, unless it was to continue.</p>

<p>The same views respecting the sacredness of the
Sabbath seem to have been entertained by the Apostles,
after the resurrection of Christ, that they held before
his death; and they appear to have occupied that
day as they had formerly done, in attending places of
public worship, and preaching the Gospel. See Acts
13:14, 42, 44, where it is said, "They came to Antioch,
in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day." After Paul had preached Christ as the
true Messiah, "and when the Jews were gone out of
the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words
might be preached to them the next Sabbath." "And
the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together
to hear the word of God." Or, see Acts 16:13,
where, "on the Sabbath we went out of the city,
by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made."
Or Acts 15:21&mdash;"For Moses, of old time, hath in
every city them that preach him, being read in the
synagogue every Sabbath day." This last passage is
given by St. James as a reason why they should write
to the Gentile converts only that "they abstain from
things offered to idols," &amp;c. From this it is apparent
that the custom was common, both to hold meetings on
the Sabbath day, and for the Gentile Christians to attend
<span class="pagenum">{4-7}</span>
those meetings. If it was not common, the reading
of Moses would not benefit them. If it was common,
then they kept the Sabbath.</p>

<p>St. Paul, in 1&nbsp;Thess. 2:14, says to the Thessalonians,
"For ye, brethren, became followers (imitators)
of the churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ
Jesus." And as these Gentile Christians were followers
of the churches in Judea, so they were ensamples,
or patterns, to all the believers in Macedonia, and
Achaia. (Ch. 1:7.) As to the character of the
churches in Judea touching the Sabbath, we need
only to consult Acts 21:20. It is there asserted, that
there were many thousands of the Jews who believed,
and that they were all zealous of the law. And the
context shows that they were zealous of even the
ceremonies of the Jewish ritual. Hence we infer,
that there was uniformity with the Jewish and Gentile
Christians, in the observance of the Sabbath, and
that the whole apostolic church religiously kept it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Sabbath continued to be observed
until the sacred canon was closed, it has been
quite common, since the Reformation, to refer to certain
passages of Scripture as indicating that the first
day had been, or was to be, substituted for the seventh.
It is said that Christ's meeting with his disciples on the
evening of his resurrection day indicates that it was
to be religiously regarded thereafter. Those who
make such use of this circumstance seem to overlook,
what it is very important to remember, that two of the
disciples traveled from Jerusalem to Emmaus and
back on that day, a distance of fifteen miles, and a part
of this in company with the Saviour. This fact alone
shows that it could not have been regarded as a Sabbath.
Nor is there any thing in the circumstances
of the meeting to indicate it. The disciples were not
<span class="pagenum">{4-8}</span>
all present, and those who were present had assembled
for other reasons, without any expectation of seeing
the Master.</p>

<p>The meeting "<i>after eight days</i>" affords no help.
Who can say positively that this expression means a
week? Or, granting that it does mean a week, what
does the passage make for the religious character of
the first day? Jesus met his disciples on one occasion
when fishing, and was seen of them forty days. Now,
if his meeting with them proves the day of that meeting
to be a Sabbath, a fishing day would be such, and
the whole forty.</p>

<p>In regard to those two places, (Acts 20:7, and
1&nbsp;Cor. 16:2,) where the expression "<i>first day of the
week</i>" occurs, they make nothing for the sanctification
of the day, since there is no hint of any such thing.
The meetings there spoken of were for special purposes,
and nothing was done at either which might not
with perfect propriety have been done on any day. It
is not quite certain that the passage, "They came together
to break bread," refers to the Lord's Supper.
Indeed, both St. Chrysostom among the ancients, and
Calvin among the moderns, deny that it was to celebrate
the Supper, and refer it to a friendly meal.</p>

<p>The text, Rev.&nbsp;1:10, where St. John was "<i>in the
spirit on the Lord's day</i>," is likewise not a good proof
text. That reference is there had to the first day of
the week, is by no means certain. There are some
who refer it to a much longer period&mdash;to the gospel
era; while others, among whom is Bede, refer it to
the day of judgment. The fact that none of those
who early mention the Lord's day refer to this passage,
is much against it. In these circumstances, it would
not be safe to draw conclusions in regard to practice
therefrom. Indeed, none of the earliest writers found
the observance of the Lord's day upon the Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-9}</span></p>

<h3 class="small">Observance of the Sabbath from the time of the Apostles to
Constantine.</h3>

<p>Thus far we have been guided by the inspired Scriptures,
and we think they prove beyond dispute, that
the Christians of the apostolic age had received no
new doctrine concerning the Sabbath, but continued
without any change to devote the seventh day of the
week to the duties of religion. But we now enter a
period in which the history of the Sabbath must be
derived from other sources. It may be difficult to
trace exactly every step which has been taken, as the
histories of the early ages are very defective on many
subjects. They have come to us, to a considerable
extent, through the church of Rome; and since she
claims to have changed the day of the Sabbath, it is
not to be expected that testimony against herself would
be very faithfully preserved. In pursuing our sketch,
we shall follow the best lights we have to guide us.</p>

<p>After the period described in the Acts of the Apostles,
Christianity soon became widely spread in the
Roman empire, which, at that time, extended over
most of the civilized world. But as it receded from
the time of the Apostles, and the number of its professors
increased, the church became gradually less
spiritual, and more disposed to deck the simple religion
of Jesus with mysteries and superstitious formalities;
and the bishops or pastors became ambitious of
their authority over the churches. Those churches,
even in Gentile cities, appear to have been composed,
at first, principally of converted Jews, who not only
observed the weekly Sabbath, but also the feast of the
Passover, adapted particularly to Christian worship;
respecting which, there was much contention. In the
mean time, converts were greatly multiplied from
among the Gentiles and were united with those from
the Jews, who, not without reason, considered themselves
<span class="pagenum">{4-10}</span>
entitled to some distinction as the original founders
of the gospel church, and as being better informed
in the writings of Moses and the prophets, having been
in the habit of reading them every Sabbath in the
synagogues.</p>

<p>About three years after the martyrdom of Peter and
Paul, according to the common account, Judea was
invaded by the Roman armies, and Jerusalem was besieged
and destroyed, as our Lord had predicted. By
this awful calamity, it is supposed that most of the
churches in Judea were scattered; for they fled their
country at the approach of their enemies, as they were
taught by Jesus Christ to do. (Matt. 24:16.) This
war resulted not only in the breaking up of the nation,
and the destruction of a great portion of the people,
but also in bringing a general odium upon the Jews
wherever they were found; so that even the Christians
of Judea suffered what our Saviour taught them
to expect, (Matt. 24:9,) "And ye shall be hated of all
nations for my name's sake." These circumstances,
added to the enmity which formerly existed between
the Gentiles and the Jews, produced a prejudice which
had its influence in the church in bringing into disrepute,
and in fixing a stigma upon, whatever was regarded
as Judaism. "The doctrines of our Saviour
and the church, flourishing from day to day, continued
to receive constant accessions," says <i>Eusebius</i>, "but
the calamities of the Jews also continued to grow with
one accumulation of evil upon another." The insurrectionary
disposition of the conquered Jews in the
reign of <i>Trajan</i>, in the early part of the second century,
and the calamities that followed them, seemed to
confirm the opinion that the Jews were given over by
the Almighty to entire destruction. But their calamities
increased in the reign of <i>Adrian</i>, who succeeded
<i>Trajan</i>, in whose reign the revolt of the Jews again
<span class="pagenum">{4-11}</span>
proceeded to many and great excesses, and <i>Rufus</i>,
the lieutenant governor of Judea, using their madness
as a pretext, destroyed myriads of men, women and
children, in crowds; and by the laws of war, he reduced
their country to a state of absolute subjection,
and the degraded race to the condition of slaves. The
transformation of the church in Jerusalem is thus described
by <i>Eusebius</i>: "The city of the Jews being
thus reduced to a state of abandonment for them, and
totally stripped of its ancient inhabitants, and also inhabited
by strangers; the Roman city which subsequently
arose changing its name, was called <i>Ælia</i>, in
honor of the emperor Ælias Adrian; and when the
church was collected there of the Gentiles, the first
bishop after those of the circumcision was <i>Marcus</i>."
Thus was extinguished the Hebrew church in Jerusalem,
having had a succession of fifteen pastors; "all
which," says <i>Eusebius</i>, "they say, were Hebrews from
the first. At that time the whole church under them,"
he adds, "consisted of faithful Hebrews, who continued
from the time of the Apostles to the siege that
then took place."</p>

<p>This church, which heretofore held the first rank in
regard to its influence, being now composed entirely
of Gentiles, and stripped of its apostolic character and
influence, could no longer successfully oppose the
growing ambition and influence of the bishops of the
church in the metropolis of the empire.</p>

<p>Up to this period, and for some time after, there
does not appear to have been any change in the sentiments
or practice of the church, in any place, relative
to the Sabbath; but from what is related by subsequent
writers, which will be noticed in its place, it is
certain that it was observed by the churches universally.
This fact is so generally acknowledged by those
<span class="pagenum">{4-12}</span>
acquainted with the history of the matter, that we need
refer to only a few passages in proof.</p>

<p>The learned <i>Grotius</i> says, in his Explication of the
Decalogue, "Therefore the Christians also, who believed
Christ would restore all things to their primitive
practice, as Tertullian teacheth in <i>Monogamia</i>,
kept holy the Sabbath, and had their assemblies on
that day, in which the law was read to them, as appears
in Acts 15:21, which custom remained till the
time of the council of Laodicea, about A. D. 365,
who then thought meet that the gospels also should be
read on that day."</p>

<p><i>Edward Brerewood</i>, Professor in Gresham College,
London, in a Treatise on the Sabbath, 1630, says:
"It is commonly believed that the Jewish Sabbath
was changed into the Lord's day by Christian emperors,
and they know little who do not know, that <i>the
ancient Sabbath did remain and was observed by the
eastern churches three hundred years after our Saviour's
passion</i>."</p>

<p>At what time the first day of the week came into
notice as a festival in the church, it is not easy to determine.
The first intimation we have of this, in any
ancient writer of acknowledged integrity, is from Justin
Martyr's Apology for the Christians, about A. D.
140. He is cited as saying, "that the Christians in the
city and in the country assembled on the day called
Sunday, and after certain religious devotions, all returned
home to their labors;" and he assigns as reasons
for this, that God made the world on the first
day, and that Christ first showed himself to his disciples
on that day after his resurrection. These were
the best, and probably all the reasons that could then
be offered for the practice. He also speaks of Sunday
only as a festival, on which they performed labor,
<span class="pagenum">{4-13}</span>
when not engaged in devotions, and not as a substitute
for the Sabbath. From this author we can learn
nothing as to the extent of the practice; for though
he says this was done by those "in the city and in the
country," he may have intended only the city of Rome
and its suburbs, since <i>Justin</i>, although a native of
Palestine in Syria, is stated by <i>Eusebius</i> to have
made his residence in Rome. Nor can we determine
from this, that he intended any thing more than that
they did thus on the Sunday in which the church of
Rome, a short time after this, is known to have closed
the paschal feast, which was observed annually.</p>

<p>It is contended, however, that mention is made of
keeping the first day previous to <i>Justin</i>. The first
intimation of this kind, it is believed, is from an apocryphal
writing, styled the <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i>; but
to this epistle it is objected, that there is no evidence
of its genuineness. <i>Eusebius</i>, who lived near the time
when it was written, mentions it as a spurious writing,
entitled to no credit. <i>Dr. Milnor</i> says it is an injury
to St. Barnabas to ascribe this epistle to him. <i>Mosheim</i>
says it is the work of some superstitious Jew of
mean abilities. And we think it has but little to recommend
it besides its antiquity. Barnabas' theory
for observing the first day, rests upon the tradition
that the seventh day was typical of the seventh millennium
of the age of the world, which would be
purely a holy age, and that the Sabbath was not to be
kept until that time arrived; and he says, "We keep
the eighth day with gladness, in which Jesus rose
from the dead."</p>

<p>The citations from <i>Ignatius</i>, are as little to the purpose.
In the passage of which most use has been
made, he did not say that himself or any one else
kept the Lord's day, as is often asserted. His own
words are, that "the prophets who lived before Christ
<span class="pagenum">{4-14}</span>
came to a newness of hope, not by keeping Sabbaths,
but by living according to a lordly or most excellent
life." In this passage, Ignatius was speaking of altogether
a different thing from Sabbath-keeping. There
is another quotation from him, however, in which he
brings out more clearly his view of the relation existing
between the Sabbath and Lord's day. It is as
follows: "Let us not keep the Sabbath in a Jewish
manner, in sloth and idleness; but let us keep it after
a spiritual manner, not in bodily ease, but in the study
of the law, and in the contemplation of the works of
God." "And <i>after</i> we have kept the Sabbath, let
every one that loveth Christ keep the Lord's day <i>festival</i>."
From this it seems that he would have the
Sabbath kept first, <i>as such</i>, and in a manner satisfactory
to the strictest Sabbatarian, after which the Lord's
day, not as a Sabbath, but as a festival. Indeed, with
this distinction between the <i>Sabbath</i> and a <i>festival</i>
before us, it is easy to explain all those passages from
early historians which refer to the first day. We shall
find them to be either immediately connected with instructions
about such seasons as <i>Good Friday</i> and
<i>Holy Thursday</i>, or in the writings of those who have
recommended the observance of these festival days.</p>

<p>It is also said that <i>Pliny</i>, Governor of Bithynia,
A. D. 102, in a letter to <i>Trajan</i>, states that the Christians
met on the first day of the week for worship; but
by no fair interpretation of his words can he be so
understood. He says, in writing about those of his
own province, "that they were accustomed to assemble
on a <i>stated day</i>." This might be referred to the
first day, if there were credible testimony that this day
was alone regarded at that time; but as there is no evidence
of this, and as the Sabbath is known to have been
the stated day of religious assembling a long time after
this, it seems more proper to refer it to the Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-15}</span>
We will mention but one more of these misinterpreted
citations, and this is from <i>Dionysius</i>, bishop of
Corinth, who lived a little after <i>Justin</i>. His letter to
<i>Soter</i>, bishop of Rome, is cited as saying, "This day
we celebrated the holy Dominical day, in which we
have read your epistle." As given by <i>Eusebius</i>, it is
thus: "To-day we have <i>passed the Lord's holy day</i>,"
&amp;c. The only ground upon which this phrase can be
referred to the first day, is, that this day was at that
time known by the same title that God has given to
the Sabbath, (see Isaiah 48:13,) of which there is no
proof. Therefore it is not just to cite this passage
as evidence of the observance of the first day at that
time.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, a well-known fact, that the first day has
come into very extensive use among the great body
of Christians, as the only day of weekly rest and worship.
The origin of this practice does not appear,
however, to be as ancient, by some centuries, as many
suppose; nor was its adoption secured at once, but by
slow and gradual advances it obtained general notice
in Christian countries. This is frankly admitted by
<i>Morer</i>, an English Episcopalian, in his <i>Dialogues on
the Lord's day</i>, p. 236. He says, "In <i>St. Jerome's</i>
time, (that is, in the fifth century,) Christianity had got
into the throne as well as into the empire. Yet for all
this, the entire sanctification of the Lord's day proceeded
slowly; and that it was the work of time to
bring it to perfection, appears from the several steps
the church made in her constitution, and from the decrees
of emperors and other princes, wherein the prohibitions
from servile and civil business advanced by
degrees from one species to another, till the day got a
considerable figure in the world." The same author
says, on the same page: "If the Christians in St. Jerome's
time, after divine service on the Lord's day,
<span class="pagenum">{4-16}</span>
followed their daily employments, it should be remembered,
that this was not done till the worship was quite
over, when they might with innocency enough resume
them, because the length of time and the number of
hours assigned for piety were not then so well explained
as in after ages."</p>

<p>It is probable that no other day could have obtained
the same notice in ancient times as the first day of the
week did; for there were circumstances, aside from
the resurrection, that had an influence in promoting
its observance. It was at first a celebration of the
same character as the fourth and sixth days of the
week, and the annual festivals of saints and martyrs.
These celebrations were comparatively unobjectionable,
when not permitted to interfere with a divine appointment;
but when they were made to supersede or
cause a neglect of the Sabbath, they were criminal.
In respect to these days of weekly celebration, <i>Mosheim</i>,
when remarking upon this early period, and the
regard then paid to the seventh and first days, says,
"Many also observed the fourth day, in which Christ
was betrayed, and the sixth day, in which he was crucified."
He adds, "The time of assembling was generally
in the evening after sunset, or in the morning
before the dawn."</p>

<p><i>The respect which the Gentiles had for the first day</i>,
or Sunday, <i>while they were Pagans</i>, contributed much
to render its introduction easy, and its weekly celebration
popular, among such materials as composed the
body of the church of Rome in the second, third, and
fourth centuries. The observance of the first day of
the week as a festival of the Sun, was very general in
those nations from which the Gentile church received
her converts. That an idolatrous worship was paid to
the Sun and other heavenly bodies by the Gentiles,
<span class="pagenum">{4-17}</span>
the Old Testament abundantly testifies; and this kind
of adoration paid to the Sun in later times, is as plainly
a matter of historical record. <i>Thomas Bampfield</i>, an
English writer of the seventeenth century, quoting
<i>Verstegan's</i> Antiquities, p. 68, says: "Our ancestors
in England, before the light of the Gospel came among
them, went very far in this idolatry, and dedicated the
first day of the week to the adoration of the idol of
the Sun, and gave it the name of Sunday. This idol
they placed in a temple, and there sacrificed to it."
He further states, that from his historical reading, he
finds that a great part of the world, and particularly
those parts of it which have since embraced Christianity,
did anciently adore the Sun upon Sunday. It
is also stated by <i>Dr. Chambers</i>, in his Cyclopedia, that
"Sunday was so called by our idolatrous ancestors,
because set apart for the worship of the Sun." The
Greeks and the Latins also gave the same name to the
first day of the week. <i>Dr. Brownlee</i>, as quoted by
<i>Kingsbury</i>, on the Sabbath, p. 223, also says, "When
the descendants of Adam apostatized from the worship
of the true God, they substituted in his place the Sun,
that luminary which, more than all others, strikes the
minds of savage people with religious awe; and which,
therefore, all heathens worship." Attachment to particular
days of religious celebration, from habit merely,
is well known, even in our own day, to be very strong,
and powerful convictions of duty are often required
to produce a change. This was no doubt well understood
by the teachers of Christianity in those times.
<i>Dr. Mosheim</i>, when treating on that age, says, "that
the leaders imagined that the nations would the more
readily receive Christianity when they saw the rites
and ceremonies to which they had been accustomed
established in the churches, and the same worship paid
to Jesus Christ and his martyrs which they had formerly
<span class="pagenum">{4-18}</span>
offered to their idol deities. Hence it happened,
that in those times, the religion of the Greeks and
Romans differed but little in its external appearance
from that of Christians."</p>

<p><i>Prejudice against the Jews</i>, was another influence
against the Sabbath, and in favor of the first day. This
was very strong, and directly calculated to lead the
Gentile Christians to fix a stigma upon every religious
custom of the Jews, and to brand as <i>Judaism</i> whatever
they supposed had any connection with the Mosaic
religion. Hence it was that in those times, as
often occurs in our own, to produce disaffection and
disgust to the seventh day as the Sabbath, they spoke
of it and reproached its observance as Judaizing. This
feeling in relation to Judaism led <i>Athanasius</i>, bishop
of Alexandria, in Egypt, in the fourth century, who
with his people then observed the Sabbath, to say, in
his <i>Interpretation of the Psalms</i>, "We assemble on
Saturday, not that we are infected with Judaism, but
to worship Jesus the Lord of the Sabbath." In a
community of Christians whose religion was formal,
and whose celebrations were designed more to act
upon their passions and senses than to improve their
hearts or to conform them to divine requirements, a
more powerful argument could scarcely be used
against the Sabbath day, or one that would more effectually
promote the observance of the first day, which
was raised up as its rival. <i>Dr. Neander</i> says distinctly,
"Opposition to Judaism introduced the particular festival
of Sunday very early."</p>

<p><i>The observance of the Passover, or Easter, by the
early Christians</i>, aided the introduction of the first
day as a religious festival in the church, if it was not
indeed the direct cause of it. This feast was held by
the Asiatic Christians, who began it at the same time
the Jews began their Passover, and ended it in like
<span class="pagenum">{4-19}</span>
manner, without regard to the particular day of the
week. The church of Rome does not appear to have
observed it until the latter part of the second century,
when, in the time of <i>Victor</i>, bishop of Rome, it seems
that it was observed by the Roman and western
churches. <i>Victor</i> insisted upon the fast being closed
on the first day of the week, on whatever day it might
commence; and he claimed the right, as bishop of
Rome, to control all the churches in this matter.
"Hence," says <i>Eusebius</i>, "there were synods and
convocations of the bishops on this question, and all
(i. e. the western bishops) unanimously drew up an
ecclesiastical decree, which they communicated to all
the churches in all places, that the mystery of our
Lord's resurrection should be celebrated on no other
day than the Lord's day, and that on this day alone
we should observe the close of the paschal feasts."
The bishops of Asia, however, persisted for a considerable
time in observing the custom handed down to
them by apostolic tradition, until, either by the threats
of excommunication which were made, or by a desire
for peace, they were induced partially to adopt the
custom of the western churches. This change was
made, as we are told, "partly in honor of the day, and
partly to express some difference between Jews and
Christians." But the question does not appear to
have been fully settled; for we find <i>Constantine</i>, in an
epistle to the churches, urging them to uniformity
in the day of the celebration, wherein, after a strong
invective against the practice of the Jews, he says,
"For we have learned another way from our Saviour,
which we may follow. It is indeed most absurd that
they should have occasion of insolent boasting on account
of our not being able to observe these things in
any manner unless by the aid of their instruction."
"Wherefore, let us have nothing in common with that
<span class="pagenum">{4-20}</span>
most odious brood of the Jews." By this contest an
important point was gained for the first day, although
it was but an annual celebration. The Sabbath, however,
does not appear to have been laid aside in any
place, but continued to be the principal day of religious
worship throughout the whole Christian church.</p>

<p>At what time the first day began to be observed
weekly, we have no particular account; but from the
favor it received from the bishops of Rome, and some
of the Christian fathers, at the close of the third and
beginning of the fourth century, we suppose it had
then become a practice in Rome and some of the
western churches.</p>

<p>This brings us to near the close of the third century.
And here it ought to be noted, that Lord's day, or
Sunday, was not the only holy-day of the Church during
these three centuries. <i>Origen</i> (as quoted by Dr.
Peter Heylyn in his History of the Sabbath) names the
<i>Good Friday</i> as we call it now, the <i>Parasceve</i> as he
calls it there; the feasts of <i>Easter</i> and of <i>Pentecost</i>.
And anciently, not only the day which is now called
<i>Whitsunday</i> or <i>Pentecost</i>, but all the fifty days from
Easter forward, were accounted holy, and solemnized
with no less observance than the Sundays were. Of
the day of the <i>Ascension</i>, or <i>Holy Thursday</i>, it may
likewise be said, that soon after, it came to be more
highly esteemed of than all the rest. Such was the
estimation in which the Lord's day was held. It was
on a level with those other holy days which are now
disregarded by the body of the Protestant Church. It
is to be remembered, farther, that the term Sabbath
was applied exclusively to the seventh day of the
week, or Saturday. Indeed, wherever, for a thousand
years and upwards, we meet the word <i>Sabbatum</i> in
any writer, of what name soever, it must be understood
of no day but Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-21}</span></p>

<h3 class="small">The Sabbath from the time of Constantine to the Reformation.</h3>

<p>We have seen how the matter stood until the commencement
of Constantine's career. The Sabbath
was generally observed, while the Lord's day was regarded
as a festival of no greater importance or authority
than Good Friday or Holy Thursday. No
text of Scripture, or edict of emperor, or decree of
council, could be produced in its favor. But from this
time forth may be found emperors and councils combining
to give importance to the Lord's day and to
oppose the Sabbath.</p>

<p>An important change in the regard paid to the first
day was produced soon after the accession of <i>Constantine</i>,
the first Christian emperor, in the early part of
the fourth century. When he became master of
Rome, he soon gave himself up to the guidance of the
Christian clergy. According to Jones' Church History,
"He built places of public worship; he encouraged
the meeting of synods and bishops; honored
them with his presence, and employed himself continually
in aggrandizing the church. He was scrupulously
attentive to the religious rites and ceremonies
which were prescribed to him by the clergy. He
fasted, observed the feasts in commemoration of the
martyrs, and devoutly watched the whole night on the
vigils of the saints," and showed great anxiety for uniformity
in the doctrines and observances of religion in
the church. He was, therefore, exactly suited to the
wishes of the Roman bishop and clergy, in establishing,
by his imperial authority, what they had no Scripture
to support, and what their influence had hitherto been
insufficient to effect, viz. a uniformity in the celebration
of Easter and the first day. In 321, <i>Constantine</i>
first published his edicts enjoining upon his subjects
these superstitious celebrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-22}</span>
<i>Eusebius</i>, in his Life of Constantine, says: "He
appointed as a suitable time for prayers the Dominical
day, which then was an especial day, and now is undoubtedly
the very first. His body guard observed
the day, and offered on it prayers written by the Emperor.
The happy prince endeavored to persuade all
to do this, and by degrees to lead all to the worship
of God; wherefore he determined that those obeying
Roman power should abstain from every work upon
the days named after the Saviour, that they should
venerate also the day before the Sabbath, in memory,
as seems to me, of the events occurring on those days
to our common Saviour." He says again, "An edict
also, by the will and pleasure of the Emperor, was
transmitted to the Prefects of the provinces, that they
thenceforth should venerate the Dominical day; that
they should honor the days consecrated to the martyrs,
and should celebrate the solemnities of the festivals in
the churches, all which was done according to the will
of the Emperor." And, as quoted by <i>Lucius</i>, he says,
that he admonished his subjects likewise that those
days which were <i>Sabbaths</i> should be honored or worshiped.</p>

<p><i>Sozomen</i>, in his Ecclesiastical History, b. 1, c. 8,
says, "He (Constantine) also made a law that on the
Dominical day, which the Hebrews call the first day
of the week, the Greeks the day of the Sun, and also
on the day of Venus, (i. e. Friday,) judgments should
not be given, or other business transacted, but that all
should worship God with prayer and supplications,
and venerate the Dominical day, as on it Christ rose
from the dead, and the day of Venus, as the day on
which he was fixed to the cross."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Chambers</i> says, "It was Constantine the Great
who first made a law for the observance of Sunday,
and who, according to Eusebius, appointed that it
<span class="pagenum">{4-23}</span>
should be regularly celebrated throughout the Roman
empire. Before him, and even in his time, they observed
the Jewish Sabbath as well as Sunday, both
to satisfy the law of Moses, and to imitate the Apostles,
who used to meet together on the first day." He adds,
"Indeed, some are of opinion that the Lord's day
mentioned in the Apocalypse is our Sunday, which
they will have to have been so early instituted." By
Constantine's laws, made in 321, it was decreed that
for the future the Sunday should be kept a day of rest
in all cities and towns; but he allowed the country
people to follow their work. In 538, the Council of
Orleans prohibited this country labor.</p>

<p>To give the more solemnity to the first day of the
week, (as we learn from Lucius' Ecclesiastical History,)
<i>Sylvester</i>, who was bishop of Rome while Constantine
was Emperor, changed the name of Sunday,
giving it the more imposing title of <i>Lord's day</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that the laws of <i>Constantine</i>
did much to make the first day conspicuous throughout
the empire, as all public business was forbidden upon
it. They changed its character from a special day, in
which, as a weekly festival, all kinds of business and
labor were performed in city and country, to be, as
<i>Eusebius</i> says, <i>the very first</i>. This imperial favor for
the first day operated against all who conscientiously
regarded the Sabbath from respect to the fourth commandment,
in obedience to which the seventh day had
always been observed; and if it had produced a general
abandonment of its observance, it would not have
been very surprising, considering the influence of
court example, and the general ignorance and darkness
of the age. This, however, does not appear to
have been the case. The Sabbath was still extensively
observed; and to counteract it the Council of <i>Laodicea</i>,
about A. D. 350, passed a decree saying, "It is
<span class="pagenum">{4-24}</span>
not proper for Christians to Judaize, and to cease from
labor on the Sabbath, but they ought to work on that
day, and put especial honor upon the Lord's day, as
Christians. If any be found Judaizing, let him be
anathematized."</p>

<p>But this did not produce any material change, for
<i>Socrates</i>, a writer of the fifth century, who resided at
Constantinople, makes the following remarks upon the
celebration of the Sabbath at the time he wrote, A. D.
440. He says, "There are various customs concerning
assembling; for though all the churches throughout
the whole world celebrate the sacred mysteries on
the Sabbath day, yet the Alexandrians and the Romans,
from an ancient tradition, refuse to do this; but
the Egyptians who are in the neighborhood of Alexandria,
and those inhabiting Thebais, indeed have assemblies
on the Sabbath, but do not participate in the
mysteries, as is the custom of the Christians. At Cæsarea,
Cappadocia, and in Cyprus, on the Sabbath and
Dominical day, at twilight, with lighted lamps, the
presbyters and bishops interpret the Scriptures. At
Rome they fast every Sabbath."</p>

<p>This account of the manner of celebrating the Sabbath
in the fifth century, is corroborated by <i>Sozomen</i>,
in his Ecclesiastical History, b. 7, c. 9. He says, "At
Constantinople, and almost among all, the Christians
assembled upon the Sabbath, and also upon the first
day of the week, excepting at Rome and Alexandria;
the ecclesiastical assemblies at Rome were not upon
the Sabbath, as in almost all other churches of the rest
of the world; and in many cities and villages in Egypt,
they used to commune in the evening of the Sabbath,
on which day there were public assemblies."</p>

<p>In regard to fasting on the Sabbath at Rome, referred
to by Socrates, it ought to be said, that from
the earliest times to the fourth century, the practice
<span class="pagenum">{4-25}</span>
had been to observe the Sabbath as a holiday. But
the Church of Rome, in its opposition to the Jews,
made it a fast day, that the separation might be marked
and strong. In the eastern churches they never
fasted upon the Sabbath, excepting one Sabbath in the
year, which was the day before the Passover. But in
the western churches they celebrated a fast every
week. It was in reference to this that <i>Ambrose</i> said,
"When I come to Rome, I fast upon the Sabbath;
when I am here, I do not fast." <i>Augustine</i> also said
concerning this, "If they say it is sinful to fast on the
Sabbath, then they would condemn the Roman Church,
and many places near to and far from it. And if they
should think it a sin not to fast on the Sabbath, then
they would blame many eastern churches, and the far
greater part of the world." This Sabbath fasting was
opposed by the eastern church; and in the sixth general
council, held at Constantinople, it was commanded
that the Sabbath and Dominical days be kept as festivals,
and that no one fast or mourn upon them. The practice
of fasting, therefore, was chiefly in the western
churches, about Rome.</p>

<p>It is perhaps difficult to determine exactly the relative
importance attached to the seventh and first days
of the week at this time. Sufficient may be found,
however, to assure us, that the Sabbath was observed,
and that no one regarded Sunday as having taken its
place. This is shown by the provision of the Council
of Laodicea, A. D. 365, that the Gospels should be
read on that day. It is shown by the action of a
Council in 517, (mentioned in <i>Robinson's History of
Baptism</i>,) which regulated and enforced the observance
of the Sabbath. It is shown by the expostulation
of <i>Gregory of Nyssa</i>, "How can you look upon
the Lord's day, if you neglect the Sabbath? Do you
not know that they are sisters, and that in despising
<span class="pagenum">{4-26}</span>
the one you affront the other?" And as sisters we
find them hand in hand in the ecclesiastical canons.
Penalties were inflicted by the council; both of Laodicea
and Trullo, on clergymen who did not observe
both days as festivals.</p>

<p>How the first day of the week, or Lord's day, was
observed in the early part of the fifth century, we may
learn from the words of <i>St. Jerome</i>. In a funeral oration
for the Lady <i>Paula</i>, he says: "She, with all her
virgins and widows who lived at Bethlehem in a cloister
with her, upon the Lord's day, repaired duly to
the church, or house of God, which was nigh to her
cell; and after her return from thence to her own
lodgings, she herself and all her company <i>fell to work</i>,
and they all performed their task, which was the
making of clothes and garments for themselves and for
others, as they were appointed."</p>

<p><i>St. Chrysostom</i>, patriarch of Constantinople, "recommended
to his audience, after impressing upon
themselves and their families what they had heard on
the Lord's day, to return to their daily employments
and trades."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Francis White</i>, Lord Bishop of Ely, speaking
of this matter, says, "The Catholic Church, for more
than six hundred years after Christ, permitted labor,
and gave license to many Christian people to work
upon the Lord's day, at such hours as they were not
commanded to be present at the public service by the
precepts of the church."</p>

<p>In the sixth century efforts were made to prevent
this labor. The following promulgation of a synod
held by command of King <i>Junthran</i>, of Burgundy,
will show the condition of things, and the means used
to improve it; "We see the Christian people, in an
unadvised manner, deliver to contempt the Dominical
day, and, as in other days, indulge on continual labor."
<span class="pagenum">{4-27}</span>
Therefore they determined to teach the people subject
to them to keep the Dominical day, which, if not observed
by the lawyer, he should irreparably lose his
cause, and if a countryman or servant did not keep it,
he should be beaten with heavier blows of cudgels.
The council of Orleans, held 538, prohibited the country
labor on Sunday which Constantine by his laws
permitted. According to Chambers, this council also
declared, "that to hold it unlawful to travel with
horses, cattle, and carriages, to prepare food, or to do
any thing necessary to the cleanliness and decency of
houses or persons, savors more of Judaism than Christianity."
According to Lucius, in another council held
in Narbonne, in France, in the seventh century, they
also forbid this country work.</p>

<p>Early in the seventh century, in the time of Pope
<i>Gregory I.</i>, the subject of the Sabbath attracted considerable
attention. There was one class of persons
who declared, "that it was not lawful to do any manner
of work upon the Saturday, or the old Sabbath;
another, that no man ought to bathe himself on the
Lord's day, or their new Sabbath." Against both of
these doctrines Pope <i>Gregory</i> wrote a letter to the
Roman citizens. <i>Baronius</i>, in his Councils, says,
"This year (603) at Rome, St. Gregory, the Pope,
corrected that error which some preached, by Jewish
superstition, or the Grecian custom, that it was a duty
to worship on the Sabbath, as likewise upon the Dominical
day;" and he calls such preachers the preachers
of Antichrist.</p>

<p>Nearly the same doctrine was preached again in the
time of <i>Gregory VII.</i>, A. D. 1074, about five hundred
years after what we are now speaking of. This is sufficient
to show that the Sabbath was kept until those
times of decline which introduced so many errors in
faith and practice. Indeed, it is sufficient to show, that
<span class="pagenum">{4-28}</span>
wherever the subject has been under discussion, the
Sabbath has found its advocates, both in <i>theory</i> and in
<i>practice</i>.</p>

<p>According to <i>Lucius</i>, Pope <i>Urban II.</i>, in the eleventh
century, dedicated the Sabbath to the Virgin
Mary, with a mass. <i>Binius</i> says, "Pope <i>Innocent I.</i>
constituted a fast on the Sabbath day, which seems to
be the first constitution of that fast; but dedicating the
Sabbath to the Virgin Mary was by <i>Urban II.</i>, in the
latter part of the eleventh century." About this time
we find <i>Esychius</i> teaching the doctrine that the precept
for the observance of the Sabbath is not one of
the commandments, because it is not at all times to be
observed according to the letter; and <i>Thomas Aquinas</i>,
another Romish ecclesiastic, saying, "that it seems to
be inconvenient that the precept for observing the Sabbath
should be put among the precepts of the Decalogue,
if it do not at all belong to it; that the precept,
'<i>Thou shall not make a graven image</i>,' and the precept
for <i>observing the Sabbath</i>, are ceremonial."</p>

<p>The observance of the first day was not so early in
England and in Scotland as in most other parts of the
Roman Empire. According to <i>Heylyn</i>, there were
Christian societies established in Scotland as early as
A. D. 435; and it is supposed that the gospel was
preached in England in the first century by St. Paul,
For many ages after Christianity was received in those
kingdoms, they paid no respect to the first day. <i>Binius</i>,
a Catholic writer, in the second volume of his works,
gives some account of the bringing into use of the Dominical
day [Sunday] in Scotland, as late as A. D.
1203. "This year," he says, "a council was held in
Scotland concerning the introduction of the Lord's day,
which council was held in 1203, in the time of Pope
<i>Innocent III.</i>," and he quotes as his authority Roger
<span class="pagenum">{4-29}</span>
Hoveden, Matth. Paris, and Lucius' Eccl. Hist. He
says, "By this council it was enacted that it should be
holy time from the twelfth hour on Saturday noon until
Monday."</p>

<p><i>Boethus</i> (de Scottis, p. 344) says, "In 1203,
<i>William</i>, king of Scotland, called a council of the
principal of his kingdom, by which it was decreed, that
Saturday, from the twelfth hour at noon, should be
holy, that they should do no profane work, and this
they should observe until Monday."</p>

<p><i>Binius</i> says that in 1201 <i>Eustachius</i>, Abbot of
Flay, came to England, and therein preached from
city to city, and from place to place. He prohibited
using markets on Dominical days; and for this he professed
to have a special command from heaven. The
history of this singular document, entitled, <i>A holy
Command of the Dominical Day</i>, the pious Abbot
stated to be this: "It came from Heaven to Jerusalem,
and was found on St. Simeon's tomb in Golgotha.
And the Lord commanded this epistle, which for three
days and three nights men looked upon, and falling to
the earth, prayed for God's mercy. And after the
third hour, the patriarch stood up; and Akarias the
archbishop stretched out his mitre, and they took the
holy epistle of God and found it thus written."</p>

 <p class="small">[We give some extracts from this epistle, partly as a matter of
 curiosity, and partly to show the credulity of our ancestors, and the
 means by which they were awed into what was to them a new religious
 observance.]</p>

 <p class="small">"I, the Lord, who commanded you that ye should observe the Dominical
 day, and ye have not kept it, and ye have not repented of your sins,
 as I said by my gospel, heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word
 shall not pass away; I have caused repentance unto life to be
 preached unto you, and ye have not believed; I sent pagans against
 you, who shed your blood, yet ye believed not; and because ye kept
 not the Dominical day, for a few days ye had famine; but I soon gave
 you plenty, and afterwards ye did worse; I will again, that none from
 the ninth hour of the Sabbath until the rising of the sun on Monday,
 do work any thing unless what is good, which if any do, let him amend
 by repentance; and if ye be not obedient to this command, amen, I say
 unto you, and I swear unto you by my seat, and throne, and cherubim,
 who keep my holy seat, because I will not change any thing by another
 epistle; but I will open the heavens, and for rain I will rain upon
 you stones, and logs of wood, and hot water by night, and
 <span class="pagenum">{4-30}</span>
 none may be able to prevent, but that I may destroy all wicked men.
 This I say unto you, ye shall die the death, because of the Dominical
 holy day and other festivals of my saints which ye have not kept. I
 will send unto you beasts having the heads of lions, the hair of
 women, and tails of camels; and they shall be so hunger-starved that
 they shall devour your flesh, and ye shall desire to flee to the
 sepulchres of the dead, and hide you for fear of the beasts; and I
 will take away the light of the sun from your eyes; and I will send
 upon you darkness, that without seeing ye may kill one another; and I
 will take away my face from you, and will not show you mercy; for I
 will burn the bodies and hearts of all who keep not the Dominical
 holy day. Hear my voice, lest ye perish in the land because of the
 Dominical holy day. Now know ye, that ye are safe by the prayers of
 my most holy mother Mary, and of my holy angels who daily pray for
 you. I gave you the law from Mount Sinai, which ye have not kept. For
 you I was born into the world, and my festivals ye have not known;
 the Dominical day of my resurrection ye have not kept; I swear to you
 by my right hand, unless ye keep the Dominical day and the festivals
 of my saints, I will send pagans to kill you."</p>

<p>Provided with this new command from heaven,
"<i>Eustachius</i> preached in various parts of England
against the desecration of the Dominical day, and
other festivals; and gave the people absolution upon
condition that they hereafter reverence the Dominical
day, and the festivals of the saints." And the people
vowed to God, that thereafter they would neither buy
nor sell any thing but food on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Then," says <i>Binius</i>, "the enemy of man, envying
the admonitions of this holy man, put it into the heart
of the king and nobility of England, to command that
all who should keep the aforesaid traditions, and chiefly
all who had cast down the markets for things vendible
upon the Dominical day, should be brought to the
king's court to make satisfaction about observing the
Dominical day."</p>

<p>Binius relates many miraculous things that occurred
on the Sabbath to those that labored after the ninth
hour (i. e. after three o'clock in the afternoon) of the
seventh day, or Saturday. He says, that upon a certain
Sabbath, after the ninth hour, a carpenter, for
making a wooden pin, was struck with the palsy; and
a woman, for knitting on the Sabbath, after the ninth
hour, was also struck with the palsy. A man baked
<span class="pagenum">{4-31}</span>
bread, and when he broke it to eat, blood came out.
Another, grinding corn, blood came in a great stream
instead of meal, while the wheel of his mill stood still
against a vehement impulse of water. Heated ovens
refused to bake bread, if heated after the ninth hour
of the Sabbath; and dough, left unbaked out of respect
to Eustachius' new doctrine, was found on Monday
morning well baked without the aid of fire. These
fables were industriously propagated throughout the
kingdom; "yet the people," says Binius, "fearing
kingly and human power more than divine, returned
as a dog to his own vomit, to keep markets of saleable
things upon the Dominical day."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bampfield</i>, in his Enquiry, p. 3, says, "The king
and princes of England, in 1203, would not agree to
change the Sabbath, and keep the first day, by this
authority. This was in the time of <i>King John</i>, against
whom the popish clergy had a great pique for not honoring
their prelacy and the monks, by one of whom
he was finally poisoned."</p>

<p><i>Binius</i> (Councils, cent. 13) states that King John of
England, in 1208, in the tenth year of his reign, for
not submitting to popish impositions upon his prerogatives,
was excommunicated by the Pope, and his kingdom
interdicted, which occasioned so much trouble at
home and abroad, that it forced him at last to lay down
his crown at the feet of Mandulphus, the Pope's
agent. After he was thus humbled by that excommunication
and interdiction, the king, in the fifteenth year
of his reign, by writ, removed the market of the city
of Exon from Sunday, on which it was held, to Monday.
The market of Lanceston was removed from
the first to the fifth day of the week. In the second
and third years of Henry III. many other markets
were removed from the first to other days of the week,
which the King at first would not permit. He also
<span class="pagenum">{4-32}</span>
issued a writ which permitted the removal of markets
from the first day to other days without special license.</p>

<p>The Parliament of England met on Sundays until
the time of Richard II., who adjourned it from that to
the following day.</p>

<p>In 1203, according to <i>Boethus</i>, "a council was held
in Scotland to inaugurate the king, and concerning
the feast of the Sabbath; and there came also a legate
from the Pope, with a sword and purple hat, and indulgences
and privileges to the young king. It was also
there decreed, that Saturday, from the twelfth hour at
noon, should be holy." The <i>Magdeburgenses</i> say that
this Council was about the observance of the Dominical
day <i>newly brought in</i>, and that they ordained that
it should be holy from the twelfth hour of Saturday
even till Monday.</p>

<p><i>Binius</i> says, "A synod was held in Oxford, A. D.
1223, by <i>Stephen</i>, Archbishop of Canterbury, where
they determined that the Dominical day be kept with
all veneration, and a fast upon the Sabbath."</p>

<p>According to Bampfield, the first law of England
made for the keeping of Sunday, was in the time of
Edward VI., about 1470. "Parliament then passed
an act, by which Sunday and many holy days, the feasts
of all Saints and of holy Innocents, were established as
festivals by law. This provided also, that it should be
lawful for husbandmen, laborers, fishermen, and all
others in harvest, or at any other time of the year when
necessity should require, to labor, ride, fish, or do any
other kind of work, at their own free will and pleasure,
upon any of the said days."</p>

<p>By such means as these, the observance of the first
day was gradually forced upon the people wherever
they owned allegiance to the Pope as head of the
church, and the Sabbath was as gradually brought into
contempt and disuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-33}</span>
The process by which the change was effected appears
to be this: By first obtaining an annual celebration
of the first day at the close of the Passover, in
honor of the resurrection; then a partial observance
of the day weekly, it being generally so observed
among the heathen; then obtaining for it the support
of civil laws, ecclesiastical canons and penalties, and
by giving it the title of Lord's day; then by requiring
the consecration of the entire day. To abate and ultimately
eradicate all respect for the Sabbath, it was
first turned into a fast; then it was dedicated to the
Virgin Mary, resting upon it was stigmatized as Judaism
and heresy, and the preaching of it was called
Antichrist; and finally the fourth commandment was
pronounced ceremonial, and was effectually abstracted
from the Decalogue. And thus, so far as the Roman
church was concerned, the point was gained; and thus,
probably, she performed her part in the fulfillment of
the prophecy of Daniel, (7:25,) "He shall think to
change <span class="smcap">times</span> and <span class="smcap">laws</span>; and they shall be given into
his hand until a time and times and the dividing of
time."</p>

<p>The cause of the Sabbath must also have been seriously
affected by the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the
seventh century, and the success of the Mahometans in
conquering the eastern division of the church. Mahomet
formed the plan of establishing a new religion,
or, as he expressed it, of replanting the only true and
ancient one professed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Jesus, and the prophets; by destroying idolatry,
and weeding out the corruptions which the later Jews
and Christians had, as he supposed, introduced. He
was equally opposed to both Jews and Christians. To
distinguish his disciples from each, he selected as their
day of weekly celebration the sixth day, or Friday.
And thus, as a writer of the seventeenth century remarks,
<span class="pagenum">{4-34}</span>
"they and the Romanists crucified the Sabbath,
as the Jews and the Romans did the Lord of
the Sabbath, between two thieves, the sixth and the
first day of the week."</p>

<p>We have thus traced the history of the Sabbath in
the Roman church down to the thirteenth century; and
we see that through the whole of this period, the seventh
day every where retained the honor of being
called the Sabbath, and that no other day had ever
borne that title; that not until the remarkable letter
found on St. Simeon's tomb, had it been asserted
by any one, that the observance of the <i>first day</i>, <i>Lord's
day</i>, or <i>Sunday</i>, was enjoined by the authority of Jesus
or his apostles, nor was any example of theirs plead
in its favor. Even then it was not pretended that the
Scriptures required its observance.</p>

<p>There are some traces of the Sabbath among those
Christians who separated from the Catholic communion,
or were never embraced in it. The Greek church
separated from them about the middle of the eleventh
century, and had a larger extent of empire than the
papists. According to <i>Brerewood's Enquiries</i>, p. 128,
this church solemnized Saturday festivals, and forbade
as unlawful to fast on any Saturday except in Lent,
retaining the custom followed before their separation.
The same author states that the Syrian Christians, who
composed a numerous body in the East, celebrated
divine worship solemnly on both the Sabbath and first
day, continuing the custom of the Roman church at
the time they separated from that community. <i>Sandy's
Travels</i>, p. 173, speak of a Christian empire in Ethiopia
that celebrate both Saturday and Sunday, "that
they have divers errors and many ancient truths." The
Abyssinian Christians, another numerous body, are
represented as being similar in some respects to the
<span class="pagenum">{4-35}</span>
Papists; and <i>Purchase</i> speaks of them as "subject to
Peter and Paul, and especially to Christ," and as observing
the Saturday Sabbath. They are also mentioned
by <i>Brerewood</i>. <i>Mosheim</i> mentions a sect of
Christians in the twelfth century, in Lombardy, called
<i>Pasaginians</i>, charged with circumcising their followers,
and keeping the Jewish Sabbath. <i>Mr. Benedict</i>
considers the account of their practicing the bloody
rite a slander charged on them on account of their
keeping the Jewish Sabbath. <i>Binius</i> says that in 1555
there were Christians in Rome who kept the Sabbath,
and were therefore called <i>Sabbatarii</i>, and they are
represented as differing in other respects from the Romanists.
Many of the Armenian Christians are believed
to observe the ancient Sabbath. <i>Dr. Buchanan</i>,
in his Researches, when speaking of those of them
who are settled in the East Indies, says, "Their doctrines
are, as far as the author knows, the doctrines of
the Bible. Besides this, they maintain the solemn observation
of Christian worship throughout our empire
on the seventh day."</p>

<p>Probably there has not existed a class of Christians
since the times of the Apostles, who could more justly
claim to be Apostolic than the <i>Waldenses</i>, formerly a
numerous people living in the valleys of Piedmont;
whither they retired, says Burnside, on the promulgation
of Constantine's laws for the observance of the
first day, in the fourth century; and where they remained,
according to Scaliger and Brerewood, in the
time of Elizabeth of England, in the latter part of
the sixteenth century. They adhered firmly to the apostolic
faith, and suffered severe persecutions from the
Catholics. <i>Robinson</i>, in his <i>History of Baptism</i>, says,
"They were called <i>Sabbati</i> and <i>Sabbatati</i>, so named
from the Hebrew word <i>Sabbath</i>, because they kept
the <i>Saturday</i> for the Lord's day." They were also
<span class="pagenum">{4-36}</span>
called <i>Insabbatati</i>, because they rejected all the festivals,
or Sabbaths, in the low Latin sense of the word.
The account the Papists gave of their sentiments in
1250, was briefly this: That they declared themselves
to be the apostolic successors, and to have apostolic
authority; that they held the church of Rome to be
the 'whore of Babylon;' that none of the ordinances
of the church which have been introduced since Christ's
ascension ought to be observed; that baptism is of no
advantage to infants, because they cannot actually believe.
They reject the sacrament of confirmation, but
instead of that their teachers lay their hands upon their
disciples. <i>Jones</i>, in his Church History, says that because
they would not observe <i>saints' days</i>, they were
falsely supposed to neglect the Sabbath also. Another
of their enemies, an Inquisitor of Rome, charged them
with despising all the feasts of Christ and his saints.
Another, a Commissioner of Charles XII. of France,
reported to him, "that he found among them none of
the ceremonies, images, or signs of the Romish church,
much less the crimes with which they were charged;
on the contrary, they kept the Sabbath day, observed
the ordinance of baptism according to the primitive
church, and instructed their children in the articles of
the Christian faith and commandments of God."</p>

<h3 class="small">The Sabbath since the Reformation.</h3>

<p>With the commencement of the Reformation, a new
spirit of religious inquiry was awakened. Nearly
every item of Christian practice was brought under
review, and not dismissed until either approved or
rejected. Among the subjects for discussion we
find the Sabbath early introduced and thoroughly examined.
There were three leading views then maintained
by different classes of Reformers, which deserve
particular notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-37}</span>
1. One class of Reformers there was, who, dwelling
alone on the sufficiency of faith, and the freeness of
the Gospel, trembled at the thought of imposing rules
upon men, and seemed to fear the term <i>law</i>. These
declared, that the law of the Sabbath was abolished;
that Sunday was no Sabbath, only a festival of the
church, which had been appointed and might be altered
at her pleasure. That we may not be thought in
error here, as well as to give a full understanding of
the opinions of that time, we will present the assertions
of some of these men.</p>

<p><i>Bishop Cranmer's Catechism</i>, A. D. 1548, says:
"The Jews were commanded in the Old Testament
to keep the Sabbath-day, and they observed it every
seventh day, called the Sabbath, or Saturday; but we
Christian men are not bound to such commandments
in Moses' law, and therefore we now keep no more
the Sabbath, or Saturday, as the Jews did, but we observe
the Sunday, and some other days, <i>as the magistrates
do judge convenient</i>."</p>

<p><i>William Tindal</i> says, in his answer to More, chap.
25: "We be lords over the Sabbath, and may change
it into Monday, or any other day, as we see need; or
may make every tenth day holy-day, only if we see
cause why; we may make two every week, if it were
expedient, and one not enough to teach the people.
Neither was there any cause to change it from the
Saturday, other than to <i>put a difference between us and
the Jews</i>, and lest we should become servants to the day
after their superstition."</p>

<p><i>Bullinger</i>, on Rev. 1:10, says: "Christian churches
entertained the Lord's day, not upon any commandment
from God, but according to their free choice."</p>

<p><i>Melancthon</i> says: "The Lord's day, from the Apostles'
age, hath been a solemn day; notwithstanding,
we find not the same commanded by any apostolic
<span class="pagenum">{4-38}</span>
law; but it is collected from hence that the observance
thereof was free, because Epiphanius and St.
Augustine testify that on the fourth and the sixth days
of the week church assemblies were held, as well as
upon the Lord's day."</p>

<p><i>The Augustan Confession</i>, drawn up by Melancthon,
and approved by Luther, says: "We teach that traditions
are not to be condemned which have a religious
end,... namely, traditions concerning holy-days,
the Lord's day, the feast of the nativity, easter, &amp;c."</p>

<p>These passages distinctly do away with the Sabbath,
and place the observance of the Lord's day on the ground
of human authority. In the books of some early authors
who adopted those views, may be found frequent
references to a difficulty which drove them to deny the
perpetuity of the Sabbath. Bishop <i>White</i>, in 1635,
says: "If the fourth commandment, concerning the
keeping of the seventh day, is moral and perpetual,
then it is not such in respect to the first and eighth
day; for this precept requireth the observance of that
one day only which it specifieth in that commandment."
In speaking of the Lord's day, he says: "Every day
of the week and of the year is the Lord's; and the
Sunday is no more the Lord's by the law of the fourth
commandment, than the Friday, for the Lord's day
of that fourth commandment is the Saturday."</p>

<p>From each of these quotations, it appears to have
been felt to be inconsistent to admit the perpetuity of
the Sabbath, without keeping the seventh day. But
to come back to this ancient day, and keep it in company
with Jews, seemed too great a change. Hence
the abrogation of the institution was asserted, as the
easiest way of escaping from the dilemma. John
Milton, speaking of this difficulty, says: "If we under
the Gospel are to regulate the time of our public worship
by the prescriptions of the Decalogue, it will
<span class="pagenum">{4-39}</span>
surely be far safer to observe <i>the seventh day</i>, according
to the express command of God, than, on the authority
of mere human conjecture, to adopt the <i>first</i>."</p>

<p>Another influence which led to the rejection of the
Sabbath by these men, was the view of it which was
held by the Romish Church. When the leaders of the
Reformation separated from that church, it was claimed
that all her festival days, including Sundays, were
holier than other days, not only in relation to the use
made of them, but to a natural and <i>inherent holiness</i>
wherewith they thought them to be invested. In addition
to this, many and hurtful restraints had been imposed
upon the consciences of God's people, until
these were days of <i>punishment</i>, rather than of holy pleasure
and profit. Seeing these days perverted from their
real design, and made the means of strengthening
papal power, it is not surprising that they were discarded
together. Anxious to escape one error, they
fell into another equally dangerous.</p>

<p>2. But another class of Reformers, (probably somewhat
fearful of the consequences of those lax notions
to which we have just referred,) considering that the
Sabbath was given in Paradise, rehearsed at Sinai, and
placed among the precepts of the Decalogue, declared
that it must be moral in its nature, and perpetually
binding. But having admitted its perpetuity, and having
rested its claims upon the fourth commandment,
the way of explaining and enforcing the change of the
day presented an obstacle to the spread of this view.
How this was treated, let their own words answer.
<i>Dr. Bound</i>, in 1595, says, "The fourth commandment
is simply and perpetually moral, and not ceremonial
in whole or in part." <i>Richard Byfield</i>, 1630, says,
"The fourth commandment is part of the law of nature,
and thus part of the image of God, and is no
more capable of a ceremony to be in it than God is."
<span class="pagenum">{4-40}</span>
Afterwards he says, "The institution of the Lord's
day is clearly in the work of Christ's resurrection, as
the institution of the seventh day was in the work of
finishing the creation." "The resurrection applieth
and determineth the Sabbath of the fourth commandment
to the Lord's day." Such was the course of
reasoning adopted by this class of persons. Having
established the morality and perpetuity of the Sabbath
by means of Scripture, and brought the sanctions of
the Word of God to sustain them, they apply all this
to the support of an institution, the existence and time
of keeping which is inferred from Christ's resurrection.
It is easy to see what must have been the consequence.</p>

<p>3. There was another class among the disputants
about the Sabbath, who endeavored, by strict adherence
to the Scriptures, to escape the difficulties
and inconsistencies into which others had been led.
They contended for the early institution of the Sabbath,
for its morality and perpetuity as inferred from
its being placed in the Decalogue, and for <i>the seventh
day of the week</i> as an essential and necessary part of
the commandment. <i>Theophilus Brabourne</i>, in 1628,
says: "1. The fourth commandment of the Decalogue
is a divine precept, simply and entirely moral,
containing nothing legally ceremonial, in whole or in
part, and therefore the weekly observation thereof
ought to be perpetual, and to continue in full force and
virtue to the world's end. 2. The Saturday, or seventh
day of the week, ought to be an everlasting holy-day
in the Christian church, and the religious observation
of this day obligeth Christians under the Gospel,
as it did the Jews before the coming of Christ.
3. The Sunday, or Lord's day, is an ordinary working
day; and it is superstition and will-worship to
make the same the Sabbath of the fourth commandment."
<span class="pagenum">{4-41}</span>
These opinions were vindicated by Brabourne
in two volumes which appeared, one in 1628,
and the other in 1632. They have never been answered
to the satisfaction of many candid mind. It is true,
an answer has been attempted. But this answer,
laboring as it did mainly to prove that such doctrine
"is repugnant to the public sentence of the Church
of England, and to the sentence of divines who lived
at the beginning of the Reformation," could not satisfy
one who believed the Scriptures to be a sufficient rule
of faith and practice. To these volumes might be
added others, which appeared soon after, and to the
results of which, living witnesses have testified from
that day to this.</p>

<p>It was while the discussion just referred to was yet
in progress, that King James, in 1618, published his
Book of Sports for Sunday, in which is set forth, that
"by the preciseness of some magistrates and ministers
in several places in this kingdom, in hindering people
from their recreations on the Sunday, the papists in
this realm being thereby persuaded that no honest
mirth or recreation was tolerable in our religion,"
wherefore, it pleased his majesty to set out his declaration,
"that for his good people's lawful recreation, his
pleasure was, that after the end of divine service,
they should not be disturbed, letted, or discouraged,
from any lawful recreation, such as dancing, either
men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or
any other such harmless recreations; nor from having
of May-games, Whitsun-ales, or Morrice-dances, and
setting up of May-poles, or other sports therewith
used; so as the same be had in due and convenient
time, without impediment or let of divine service."
This book was designed to counteract what was then
called the Puritan notion, and maybe regarded as expressing
the opinion of the English Church at that
<span class="pagenum">{4-42}</span>
time in regard to the sacredness of the day. It was
re-published in 1636, by Charles, with how much real
effect upon the practices of his subjects it is not easy
to determine.</p>

<p>It is evident that a reäction in favor of the sabbatic
institution had already commenced; and the earnestness
of Puritanism on this subject, joined to the influence
of Sabbatarianism, affected almost the whole body
of the English Church. To Puritanism and Sabbatarianism
belong the credit of having preserved to
that country a regard for the day of rest, which raises
it indefinitely above many other Protestant countries.
Had Scriptural ground been taken, who can
estimate the results which would have followed?</p>

<p>In Germany, according to Ross' "Picture of all
Religions," observers of the seventh-day as the Sabbath
were common in the sixteenth century, their
numbers being such as to lead to organization, and attract
attention. A number of these formed a church,
and emigrated to America in the early settlement of
the country. There were Sabbath-keepers in Transylvania,
about the same time, among whom was <i>Francis
Davidis</i>, first chaplain to the Court of Sigismund,
the prince of that kingdom, and afterwards superintendent
of all the Transylvanian churches. In France,
also, there were Christians of this class, among whom
was <i>M. de la Roque</i>, who wrote in defense of the
Sabbath, against Bossuet, the Catholic Bishop of
Meaux. But it is difficult to determine to what extent
this day was observed in those countries.</p>

<p>In England we find Sabbath-keepers very early.
<i>Dr. Chambers</i> says, "They arose in England in the
sixteenth century;" from which we understand that
they then became a distinct denomination in that kingdom.
They increased considerably in the seventeenth
<span class="pagenum">{4-43}</span>
century; and we find that towards the close of that
century there were eleven flourishing churches in
different parts of that country. Among those who
held this view were some men of distinction. Theophilus
Brabourne was called before the Court of High
Commission, in 1632, for having written and published
books vindicating the claims of the seventh day. One
Traske was about the same time examined in the Starr
Chamber, where a long discussion on the subject
seems to have been held. Nearly thirty years after
this, John James, preacher to a Sabbath-keeping congregation
in the east of London, was executed in a
barbarous manner, upon a variety of charges, among
which was his keeping of the Sabbath. Twenty years
later still, Francis Bampfield died in Newgate, a martyr
to non-conformity&mdash;especially as one who could
not conform in the matter of the Sabbath. It is needless
to mention more names, or to speak particularly
of Edward, Joseph, Dr. Joseph, and Dr. Samuel Stennett,
John Maulden, Robert Cornthwaite, and others,
who have written and suffered in proof of their attachment
to this truth.</p>

<p>But the Sabbath met with great opposition in England,
being assailed, both from the pulpit and the press, by
those who were attached to the established church.
Many men of learning and talent engaged in the discussion,
on both sides of the question. It is evident that
the opposers of reform felt the difficulty of defending
themselves against the strength of talent and scripture
brought to bear in favor of the seventh day. The
civil powers attempted to check the progress of all
Dissenters by means of the famous <i>Conventicle Act</i>. By
that law, passed in 1664, it was provided, that if any
person, above sixteen years of age, was present at any
meeting of worship different from the Church of England,
where there were five persons more than the
<span class="pagenum">{4-44}</span>
household, for the first offense he should be imprisoned
three months, or pay five pounds; for the second, the
penalty was doubled; and for the third he should be
banished to America, or pay one hundred pounds sterling.
This act was renewed in 1669, and, in addition
to the former penalties, made the person preaching
liable to pay a fine of twenty pounds; and the same
penalty was imposed upon any person suffering a meeting
to be held in his house. Justices of the Peace
were empowered to enter such houses, and seize such
persons; and they were fined one hundred pounds if
they neglected doing so. These acts were exceedingly
harrassing to those who observed the Sabbath. Many
of their distinguished ministers were taken from their
flocks and confined in prison, some of whom sunk under
their sufferings. These persecutions not only
prevented those who kept the Sabbath from assembling,
but deterred some who embraced their opinions
from uniting with them, and discouraged others from
investigating the subject. At present the Sabbath is
not as extensively observed in England as formerly.
But the extent of Sabbath-keeping cannot be determined
by the number and magnitude of the churches,
either there or in other countries. For many persons
live in the observance of the seventh day and remain
members of churches which assemble on the first day;
and a still greater number acknowledge its correctness,
who conform to the more popular custom of keeping
the first day.</p>

<p>At what time the Sabbath became the subject of
attention in America, we cannot definitely say. The
intolerance of the first settlers of New England was
unfavorable to the Sabbath. The poor Christian who
may have been banished to this country for its observance
could find no refuge among the <i>Pilgrim Fathers</i>.
The laws of Rhode Island were more tolerant than
<span class="pagenum">{4-45}</span>
those of some other States, and observers of the Sabbath
first made their appearance at Newport in 1671.
The cause of the Sabbath has gradually gained ground
in this country from that period; but it has found
much to oppose its progress, even in Rhode Island.
It was in opposition to the general practice of Christians,
on which account an odium was put upon it, and
those who have kept the Sabbath have been reproached
with Judaizing, and classed with Jews. Besides
this, they have ever been subjected to great inconvenience
in their occupations, especially in cities and
towns.</p>

<p>At no time does there appear to have been in this
country any general excitement on the subject. The
observers of Sunday have avoided as far as possible
its discussion; so that those who have observed the
Sabbath have had but little encouragement, as they
have supposed, to try to extend their sentiments. But
the propagation of their opinions has not depended
exclusively on their efforts. The common English
version of the Bible has been found in many instances
a sufficient means of converting men to the truth.
Churches observing the Sabbath have been formed in
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and
in most of the Western States, embracing, as is supposed,
a population of forty or fifty thousand.</p>

<h3 class="small">Conclusion.</h3>

<p>From the foregoing historical sketch, it appears that
through the apostolic age, and for a long time after,
the Sabbath was religiously observed by the church
of Christ; and that not until the latter part of the
second century was the first day introduced to religious
notice as a festival of the resurrection; and then,
<span class="pagenum">{4-46}</span>
probably, as an annual celebration at the close of the
Passover only. It also appears, that it was a work of
some hundreds of years to establish the weekly celebration
of this day, even in the Romish church; and
that this was not done without the aid of ecclesiastical
and civil laws and penalties&mdash;the same instrumentalities
used to bring the Sabbath into disrepute in the
popular branches of the church. Thus it appears that
the Romish clergy, and the princes under their control,
have been the principal actors in bringing about
the change from the Sabbath to the first day of the
week.</p>

<p>For a long time before the Reformation the popular
branches of the Christian church were literally without
a Sabbath. Until after that period, it is not known
that a single passage of Scripture was ever cited as
authority for the celebration of the first day, even as
a festival; the notion that the apostles observed it as a
memorial of the resurrection, being of comparatively
modern origin. When, however, the Reformers threw
off the yoke of the Romish church, and protested
against her corruptions, some of them could no longer
be satisfied to let the observance of the first day rest
upon her authority. They saw that they must either
give it up as a human invention, or find some Scripture
to support it. Hence the numerous theories
which have been invented to justify its observance&mdash;theories
which necessarily conflict with each other, as
well as with Scripture, and are altogether unsatisfactory
to inquiring minds.</p>

<p>The history of this matter shows us, that neither
the adoption of the first day, nor the abandonment of
the seventh, took place until the corruptions of the
Catholic church in other respects had become so numerous
and flagrant, as to drive from her communion
<span class="pagenum">{4-47}</span>
many of her most conscientious and apostolic members,
who still retained the observance of the Sabbath.
The case of those sects in different ages of the church
who have kept the Sabbath in connection with the first
day, and practiced other things peculiar to the Romish
church, furnishes additional evidence that the observance
of the first day was adopted while the Sabbath
was retained, and consequently that the first day was
not adopted as a substitute for the Sabbath, which it
ultimately displaced. The permitting of labor on the
first day in the earlier ages of the church, and the
canons of Councils and Synods and the edicts of
Princes to bring about a general conformity in this
respect, together with the slow progress made, even
in Catholic countries, evince in the strongest manner
that it was viewed in no other light, even by its warmest
advocates, than that of a human institution, and
one that could be enforced by human authority only.
As such it was looked upon by enlightened and conscientious
Christians in every age, who would not
make void a commandment of God through a tradition
of men.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts, we are led to the conclusion
of Dr. Neander, set forth in his Church History,
that "the festival of Sunday was always only a human
ordinance, and it was far from the intention of the
Apostles to establish a divine command in this respect,
far from them, and from the early apostolic church, to
transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday." As a
"<i>human ordinance</i>," the observance of Sunday has
long been and is now considered by many. While
they consider it in this light, it is not to be expected
that they will render it that sacred regard which the
Sabbath claims, and must have in order to our safety
and its usefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{4-48}</span>
What, then, shall be done? Shall we allow an institution
of so much importance to rest upon mere
human authority? To such a proposition every friend
of the institution ought to say, No. To set it adrift,
or to attempt to enforce it upon such authority, would
be to withdraw from it the high sanction which it once
had, and expose it to certain contempt and neglect.
There is but one course dictated by wisdom and prudence.
If we would save the Sabbath from threatened
destruction, we must come back to the law as it
was originally given, place the institution under the
care of the Lawgiver, and enforce its claims by his
authority. We must join the commandment, "Remember
the Sabbath day to keep it holy," with the
explanation of it, "The seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God," and united they shall stand.
Let this be done, and we need not fear. The Lord
of the Sabbath is pledged for its safety; and he will
cause those who "call the Sabbath a delight, holy of
the Lord, honorable," to rejoice in Him, and ride
upon the high places of the earth.</p>

<h2>A CHRISTIAN CAVEAT<br /><br /><span
          class="x-small">TO THE</span><br /><br /><span
          class="small">OLD AND NEW SABBATARIANS.</span><br /><br /></h2>

<p class="x-small">BY EDWARD FISHER, ESQ.</p>

</div>

 <p class="small">The following article is taken from the fifth edition of a work with
 the above title, printed in London, 1653. The book was written in
 defence of the "orthodoxal doctrine of the Church of England,"
 respecting festivals, against the "Sabbatarian novelties," as they
 were called, of the Puritans. While it demolishes the claims set up
 on behalf or <i>Sunday</i> or <i>Lord's Day</i>, it fully establishes
 the claims of the <i>Sabbath</i> or <i>Seventh Day</i>. And it is
 worthy of note here, that it is not possible to refute any of the
 erroneous views in regard to the Sabbath and Lord's Day, without
 taking positions which necessarily lead to the observation of <i>the
 Seventh Day</i>. How much easier it would be to fasten the claims of
 the Sabbatic institution upon the consciences of men, if we were
 satisfied to take the fourth commandment <i>as it reads</i>, and
 enforce it by "<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>."</p>

<p>"The third opinion is, of the new Sabbatarians, who
dream of a middle way betwixt a Jew and a Christian; and
this they usually lay down in two propositions. The first is,
<i>That the Lord's Day, or first day of the week, namely</i>
Sunday, <i>may be called</i> the Sabbath: the next is, <i>That the
observation of the Lord's Day is a moral duty, enjoined by
God himself, and declared both by the doctrine and practice
of Christ and his apostles</i>. The first appearance of this kind
of teachers was in the year of our Lord 1595, near the end
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth: and because they are
neither able to produce direct Scripture, nor solid reason for
what they say, they labor to support their conceits by
fallacies, falsities and wrestings of God's holy word, as
upon scanning their proofs will be manifest to the meanest
capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{5-2}</span>
"For their first proposition, they alledge two reasons why
the <i>Lord's Day</i> may be called <i>the Sabbath</i>. One is because
the Sabbath signifies <i>a rest</i>; and therefore the Lord's Day
being a <i>rest</i>, may be called the Sabbath. But to this we
answer, it is false that <i>the Sabbath</i> signifies <i>a rest</i>; for when
by custom of speech a common name is restrained to a particular
place, thing, or person, it then becomes a proper
name, and so losing its community, does signify that only
particular, unto which by custom of speech it is applied; as
for instance, <i>the temple</i> is a common name, signifying <i>the
Church</i>; yet in London, where by custom of speech this
name, <i>The Temple</i>, is restrained to an Inns of Court, it is
false and absurd to say you were at <i>the Temple</i>, and mean
<i>the Church of St. Giles</i>. In like manner <i>the Sabbath</i> is a
common name, signifying <i>the rest</i>; yet in the Christian
Church, where by custom of speech, according to God's
holy phrase throughout the Old and New Testament, this
name, <i>the Sabbath</i>, is restrained to the Jewish weekly festival,
it is false and absurd to speak of <i>the Sabbath</i>, and mean
<i>the Lord's Day</i>. Their other reason why the Lord's Day
may be called <i>the Sabbath</i>, is, because the Lord's Day succeeded
in the room of the Sabbath. But if this argument
be good, then may <i>baptism</i> be called <i>circumcision</i>, the <i>Lord's
Supper</i> the <i>Passover</i>, and King <i>James</i> Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>"As for the second proposition, wherein they assert the
<i>morality and divine institution of the Lord's Day</i>, we shall
here notice only three of their reasons. The first is, because
Adam, according to God's command, kept the Sabbath in
the state of innocency.... But what is the sanctification
of the Sabbath spoken of by Moses in the second chapter of
Genesis, to our observing the Lord's Day? That was appointed
to be kept on <i>the seventh</i> and <i>last</i> day of the week;
this is kept on <i>the first</i> day of the week: that was the day in
which God <i>rested</i> from his work of creation; this is the day
in which God <i>began</i> to create the heavens and the earth:
that was our <i>Saturday</i>; this is our <i>Sunday</i>. Their second
proof for the morality of the Lord's Day, is from the fourth
commandment, where they seek to corrupt the very text, and
would persuade us that for <i>the</i> seventh day, we must read <i>a</i>
seventh day; as if God did not there set apart a certain day
of the week, but left it to man to keep which of the seven he
pleased. Unto which we answer, that this conceit is not
only against the letter of all our translations, but even repugnant
to the sense of the commandment; for the words
<span class="pagenum">{5-3}</span>
are express that God blessed and hallowed the Sabbath
day; that Sabbath day was <i>the seventh</i> day; that seventh
day was <i>the day in which God rested from his six days'
work of creation</i>. Nay, grant it were true (as these men
would have) that this special precept does exactly oblige us,
and that no particular day of the seven was by God appointed
to be kept holy, then may we set apart Monday, or Tuesday,
or any other day to God's service, as well as Sunday;
and so, by their own argument, the Lord's Day is no more
moral than any other day of the week. Their third proof is
from the title or name, <i>Lord's Day</i>, which (say they) cannot
be for any other reason, but because it is of the Lord's institution.
We answer, this is false; for the Lord's Day was
not so called because it was <i>instituted by the Lord</i>, but because
it was <i>dedicated to the Lord</i>; as we commonly say,
Saint Mary's Church, or Saint Peter's Church; which no
man did ever imagine were built or founded by Saint Mary
or Saint Peter."</p>

 <p class="small">Near the close of his book, after having examined each of the
 positions here referred to, he comes directly to his design, and
 says:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In vain, therefore, it is, and most absurd, for you our
opponents to charge us with <i>befooling and misleading the
people</i>. Your own <i>practice</i>, your own <i>doctrines</i>, shall bear
witness betwixt us.</p>

<p>"You who say one while, that God did not appoint <i>the</i>
seventh day, the day on which he rested, to be kept holy,
but <i>a</i> seventh day, and so one day in seven be observed, no
matter which of them; another while, that by this commandment
God enjoins us to keep holy <i>the first day of the week</i>
on which he <i>began</i> his work of creation&mdash;Do you not <i>befool
and mislead the people</i>?="You who (forgetting your own doctrine of the fourth
commandment) do teach, that the keeping holy the first day
of the week, or Lord's Day, was appointed and practised by
Christ and his apostles, yet cannot produce so much as one
<i>example</i> for it, much less a <i>precept</i>&mdash;Do you not <i>befool and
mislead the people</i>?</p>

<p>"You who infer, because St. Paul, and the disciples at
Troas, spent the whole night of the first day of the week in
praying, preaching, and heavenly conference, in regard he
was to leave them and depart on the morrow; <i>therefore</i>, St.
Paul and the disciples at Troas met <i>that night</i> to keep holy
<i>the day past</i>; <i>therefore</i> the disciples at Troas met <i>every first
<span class="pagenum">{5-4}</span>
day of the week</i>, to keep that day holy; <i>therefore</i> the Church
at <i>Philippi</i>, the Church in <i>Cilicia</i>, and <i>all</i> Christian
Churches, did then keep holy the first day of the week;
<i>therefore all the apostles</i> did constantly keep holy that day;
<i>therefore</i> Christ and his apostles <i>appointed the first day of
the week</i> to be for ever celebrated, instead of the Sabbath&mdash;Is
not this pitiful logic? Do you not <i>befool and mislead the
people</i>?</p>

<p>"You who tell stories of an <i>old</i> Sabbath and a <i>new</i> Sabbath,
a <i>Jewish</i> Sabbath and a <i>Christian</i> Sabbath, a Sabbath
of the <i>seventh</i> day and a Sabbath of the <i>first</i> day of the
week; that so you may slily fix the name <i>Sabbath</i> on <i>the
Lord's Day</i>, and then persuade the simple and ignorant that
all those texts of Scripture wherein mention is made of <i>the
Sabbath day</i>, are intended of <i>the Lord's Day</i>; when indeed
to call the Lord's Day <i>the Sabbath</i>, is as senseless as to call
Sunday <i>Saturday</i>, or the <i>first</i> day <i>the last day</i> of the week,
when throughout the Old and New Testament we have not
the least intimation of any other weekly Sabbath, save the
old, Jewish, seventh day Sabbath; when you yourselves
confess, that the name Lord's Day, is more proper and particular,
and less obvious to exception, than the name Sabbath;
and that the name Sabbath is in dignity inferior to
both Lord's Day and Sunday&mdash;Do you not <i>befool and mislead
the people</i>?</p>

<p>"You that condemn the yearly observance of Christ's
birth-day as heathenish, yet acknowledge this feast to be a
constitution of the ancient primitive Church&mdash;Do you not
<i>befool and mislead the people</i>?</p>

<p>"Take ye heed; these are not small matters; consider
well with yourselves what it is to stand guilty before God
of belying Christ and his apostles, and wilfully wresting the
Holy Scriptures. Be advised; take time while time is to
repent of those notorious slanders wherewith you have aspersed
the ancient approved ways of God's worship; and
let the sincerity of your repentance appear by the speedy
abandoning of your unchristian practices and principles;
lest the heavy judgment of seducers, <i>to wax worse and
worse</i>, fall upon you, and God in the end <i>deliver you up</i> to
such <i>strong delusions</i>, that you <i>should believe your own
lies</i>."</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">TWENTY REASONS</span><br /><br />
    <span class="x-small">FOR KEEPING HOLY IN EACH WEEK,</span><br /><br />
    THE SEVENTH DAY INSTEAD OF THE FIRST DAY.</h2>

</div>

<p>1. Because the Seventh Day was blessed and sanctified
for a Sabbath, by God, immediately after the creation
of the world, as a perpetual memorial of that wonderful
work, and of His own resting from it; and because
there is now as much need for man to remember
God's creative work, and to enjoy a weekly rest, as ever
there was.</p>

<p>2. Because there is evidence that the Seventh Day
was observed from Adam to Moses, by Noah, Jacob,
Joseph, and Job. (See Gen. vii.&nbsp;4, 10; viii.&nbsp;10, 12;
xxix.&nbsp;27, 28; l.&nbsp;10; Job. ii.&nbsp;3.)</p>

<p>3. Because the Seventh Day is a necessary part of
the fourth commandment, given at Mount Sinai, graven
on stone by the finger of God, and incorporated with
the other nine precepts of the Decalogue, which are
admitted to be moral in their nature, and perpetually
binding. "Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it
holy." "The Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God." "For in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested
the <i>Seventh Day</i>; <i>wherefore</i> the Lord blessed the Sabbath
Day and hallowed it."</p>

<p>4. Because the Old Testament abounds with declarations
of God's blessing upon those who keep holy the
Seventh Day, and of his vengeance upon those who
profane it.</p>

<p>5. Because our Lord Jesus Christ enforced the
claims of the law to the fullest extent, saying in regard
to the code to which the Seventh Day belonged, "Till
heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
<span class="pagenum">{6-2}</span>
wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled;" and because
He always kept holy the Seventh Day, in this
doubtless "leaving us an example that we should follow
in His steps."</p>

<p>6. Because the holy women who had attended Jesus
Christ at his death and burial, are expressly said to have
"rested the <span class="smcap">Sabbath Day</span> <i>according to the commandment</i>,"
(Luke xxiii.&nbsp;56;) and because, though the narrative
proceeds immediately to record the appearance of
Jesus Christ, on the morning of the <i>first day of the
week</i>, neither there nor elsewhere is one word said about
a change of the Sabbath, or about the sabbatic observance
of the First Day of the Week.</p>

<p>7. Because the Apostles of our Lord constantly
kept the Seventh Day, of which there is abundant evidence
in the Acts of the Apostles, and it is declared of
Paul, that, "<i>as his manner was</i>," he went into the synagogue
frequently on the Sabbath Day. (Compare Luke
iv.&nbsp;16 with Acts xvii.&nbsp;2; see also Acts xiii.&nbsp;14, 42, 44,
and xvi.&nbsp;13.)</p>

<p>8. Because Jesus Christ, foretelling the destruction
of Jerusalem, warned his disciples to pray that their
flight might not happen "on the Sabbath Day;" and as
that event was to take place almost forty years after the
resurrection of our Lord, it appears that the same Sabbath
was to be then observed by his disciples.</p>

<p>9. Because there is no other day of the week
called by the name of "Sabbath," in all the Holy Scriptures,
but the Seventh Day alone; and because, when
"the First Day of the Week" is mentioned in the New
Testament, it is always clearly distinguished from "the
Sabbath."</p>

<p>10. Because not one of those passages which speak
of the "First Day of the Week," records an event or
transaction peculiar to the Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{6-3}</span>
11. Because when God had so carefully committed
his Law to writing, had repeated his precepts throughout
the prophetic books, and had left so many testimonies
and examples of the Seventh Day Sabbath on His
sacred records, it is most unreasonable to suppose that
He would have repealed or changed one single article
thereof, without recording it among the words of our
Lord Jesus or His Apostles, in the writings of the New
Testament.</p>

<p>12. Because the observance of the Moral Law,
(without any exception from it,) is constantly enjoined,
in the writings of the Apostles; and one of them says
that "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend
in one point, he is guilty of all," quoting at the
same time the sixth and seventh commandments. (See
Rom. xiii.&nbsp;9; Gal. v.&nbsp;14; Eph. vi.&nbsp;2, 3; and James ii.&nbsp;8-11.)</p>

<p>13. Because the religious observance of the <i>Seventh
Day</i> of the Week <i>as the Sabbath</i>, was constantly practised
by the primitive Christians, for three or four hundred
years at least; and because, though it gradually
fell into disuse, the neglect of the Sabbath was caused
only by those corruptions of Christianity, which at length
grew up into the grossest idolatry; so that the second
commandment was in fact, and the fourth was in effect,
abolished by an ignorant, superstitious, and tyrannical
priesthood.</p>

<p>14. Because it was only through the superstitious
observance of the anniversaries of saints and martyrs,
and a multitude of other fasts and feasts, with which
the simplicity of revealed religion was encumbered and
overwhelmed, that the sabbatic observance of the Seventh
Day went out of use; and not (in fact) by any real
or pretended command of Christ or His apostles, nor at
first by the express authority of any Pope or Council:
for it was kept <i>as a strict fast</i>, for ages after it lost
every other token of a holy day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{6-4}</span>
15. Because the leaders of the Reformation never
claimed for the First Day the name of the Sabbath, and
never enforced the observance of that day by any other
authority than that of the Church.</p>

<p>16. Because it is obviously absurd&mdash;(<i>and it is an
objection often made by irreligious people</i>)&mdash;that the observance
of the First Day of the Week as the Sabbath,
should be grounded on a divine precept which commands
the observance, not of the <i>First</i>, but of the
<i>Seventh</i> Day.</p>

<p>17. Because, if the fundamental principle of Protestantism
be right and true, that "the Bible alone is
the religion of Protestants," then the Seventh Day must
be the true and only <i>Sabbath of Protestants</i>; for, unless
that day of the week be kept, they have no <i>scriptural</i>
Sabbath at all.</p>

<p>18. Because the pertinacious observance of the
First Day of the Week, in the stead of the Seventh, has
actually given occasion of great scandal to the Protestant
faith; it has caused the Papists to declare that Protestants
admit the <i>authority of human tradition</i> in matters
of religion; and it has led to intolerance and persecution.</p>

<p>19. Because the observance of the First Day, and
neglect of the Seventh, having been adopted partly in
contempt of the Jews, has always laid a burden upon
them, and presented an obstacle to their receiving
Christianity, which ought to be removed.</p>

<p>20. Because the observance of the Seventh Day
obeys God, honors the Protestant Principle, rebukes
Papacy, removes stumbling-blocks, and secures for us
the presence and blessing of "the Lord of the Sabbath."</p>

<h2>PLAIN QUESTIONS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Reader! be pleased to give a plain answer
to each of these plain questions, without
equivocation or mental reservation.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>1. Did God, after he had finished the work of creation,
"bless and sanctify" <span class="smcap">the</span> <i>seventh day of the week</i>;
or simply the <i>seventh part of time</i>, without reference to
any <i>particular day</i> of the seven?</p>

<p>2. Did He not sanctify <span class="smcap">the</span> <i>very day in which he
rested</i> from his work? Was not that <i>the last day</i> of the
seven? Did He sanctify any other?</p>

<p>3. WHY did He "bless and sanctify" <i>the</i> seventh
day? Was it not because he <i>rested</i> on that day? Will
this reason apply to <i>any other day</i> of the seven? Did he
not <i>work</i> on EVERY other day? (See Gen. 2:2, 3.)</p>

<p>4. Is not God's example of resting on the seventh day
enjoined upon us for imitation? (Ex. 20:8-11.) Do
we imitate him, when we rest upon some other day than
the one in which He rested?</p>

<p>5. Is it the special <i>appointment of God</i> which renders
a day holy, or is it <i>our own act</i>? Is the day holy because
we <i>count</i> it so, or because God has made it so?</p>

<p>6. When God enjoins us to count the Sabbath, "the
holy of the Lord," (Isa. 58:13,) is it not equivalent to
telling us that He himself has <i>previously</i> constituted it a
holy day by blessing and sanctifying it? Is it any thing
more than requiring us to reckon the day to possess that
dignity which He <i>has already</i> conferred upon it?</p>

<p>7. If God's blessing does not rest upon one particularly
specified day, to the exclusion of all others, and we are
<span class="pagenum">{7-2}</span>
nevertheless required to keep a day holy, are we not required
to do what <i>is impossible</i>? For how can we
count a day to be holy, which God has not previously
made so? (Compare Quest. 5.)</p>

<p>8. If God's blessing did not rest upon one particularly
specified day, could he challenge to himself any propriety
in one day more than in another? Yet in the Sabbath
day he claims a special propriety; "<span class="smcap">My</span> <i>holy day</i>." (Isa.
58:13.)</p>

<p>9. Are we not commanded to refrain from labor in
<i>that very day</i> which God once "blessed and sanctified,"
and thereby made holy time? "In IT thou shalt not
do any work," &amp;c. Do we obey this command when
we work all of that day, and make it the busiest day of
all the seven?</p>

<p>10. If it be downright disobedience to set about our
work on the seventh day, when God says, "in <i>it</i> thou
shalt NOT do any work," can we think to make amends
for this act of disobedience by ceasing from work on another
day? Even the performance of a required duty will
not make amends for another one neglected. How much
less, then, the performance of something which is not required!
"Who hath required this at your hand?"</p>

<p>11. Has God ever <i>taken away</i> the blessing which he
once put upon the seventh day, and made that day a common
or secular day?</p>

<p>12. Does not the <i>reason</i> of the blessing (See Quest.
3,) possess all the cogency now that it ever did? Has it
lost force by the lapse of time? And while the reason of
an institution remains, does not the institution itself remain?</p>

<p>13. Was the reason of the blessing which God originally
put upon the seventh day, founded upon any need
that men then had of a Redeemer? Was it therefore to
receive its accomplishment and fulfillment by the actual
<span class="pagenum">{7-3}</span>
coming of the Redeemer? In what possible sense can it
be said, that Jesus Christ fulfilled and made an end of this
reason?</p>

<p>14. Has God ever said of the first day of the week, In
<i>it</i> thou shalt not do any work? Has Christ ever said so?
Have the apostles?</p>

<p>15. Is there any scriptural proof that Christ, or his
apostles, or the Christian churches in the days of the apostles,
<i>refrained from labor</i> on the first day of the week?</p>

<p>16. As there is no transgression where there is no
law, (Rom. 4:15; John 3:4,) what sin is committed by
working on the first day of the week?</p>

<p>17. Does not the Sabbatic Institution RESULT from
the blessing and sanctifying of <i>a particular day</i>? Is not
this <i>the very thing in which it consists</i>? How then is
the institution <i>separable</i> from the day thus "blessed and
sanctified"? How can it be separated from that upon
which its very existence depends?</p>

<p>18. If the very life and soul of the institution consist
in the blessing which was once put upon a particular day,
is it not idle to talk of the <i>transfer</i> of the institution to
another day? If another day has been sanctified and
blessed, then it is an <i>entirely new</i> institution, and not a
transfer of the old.</p>

<p>19. Does not the law of the Sabbath require the weekly
commemoration of <i>that</i> rest which God entered into
after he had finished the work of creation? By what
principle of law or logic, then, can that law be made to
<i>require</i> the commemoration of the work of redemption?</p>

<p>20. If it be necessary that the work of redemption be
commemorated weekly by a positive institution, must not
the obligation so to commemorate it arise from some law
which directly and specifically requires it? But when,
instead of this, the attempt is made to derive the obligation
from the Sabbath law, is it not a tacit acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum">{7-4}</span>
that there is no law requiring the weekly commemoration
of the work of redemption?</p>

<p>21. Does the Scripture ever apply the name, <i>Sabbath</i>,
to the first day of the week? Even in the <i>New</i> Testament,
where the term is used, is not the reference always
to the <i>seventh</i> day?</p>

<p>22. If Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles ful
thirty years after the death of Christ, under the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit, still calls the seventh day of the week the
Sabbath, can it be wrong in us to do so? (See Acts 13:14,
42, 44; 16:1, 3; 17:1, 2; 18:4.) If this be the
<i>inspired</i> application of the term so many years after all
the ceremonial institutions were nailed to the cross, is it
not our duty to make the same use of the term now?</p>

<p>23. Is it not a manifest perversion of the scriptural
use of terms, to take away the sacred name from the seventh
day of the week, and give it to the first day?</p>

<p>24. When the first day of the week is so generally
called the Sabbath, are not the common people thereby
led to suppose that the Bible calls it so? Are they not
thus grossly deceived?</p>

<p>25. If the name <i>Sabbath</i> were no longer applied to
this day, and it should simply be called first day of the
week, as in the Bible, is it not probable that it would soon
lose its sacredness in the eyes of the people?</p>

<p>26. Is it possible, then, that God has not given the
day a name sufficiently sacred to secure for it a religious
regard, nor even guarded it with a law sufficient to prevent
its desecration?</p>

<p>27. <i>What then?</i> HAS GOD LEFT HIS WORK
FOR MAN TO MEND! IS IT NOT SAFE TO
LEAVE THE DAY AS GOD HAS LEFT IT!
"Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his
counsellor hath taught him?" (Isa. 11:13.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{7-5}</span>
28. Are you very sure that by the Lord's day, (Rev.
1:10,) is meant the first day of the week? Have you
any <i>Scripture</i> proof of it? Have you any other proof of
it than the testimony of those who are called the early Fathers?</p>

<p>29. If the testimony of the early Fathers is to be relied
on, that the Lord's day means the first day of the week,
ought not their testimony to be just as much relied on, as
to the manner in which the primitive Christians observed
the day?</p>

<p>30. If it were even certain that by the Lord's day the
writer of the book of Revelations meant to designate the
first day of the week, would it thence follow that it is a
day <i>sacred</i> by <i>divine</i> appointment, any more than that
the "<i>Sabbath day's journey</i>" (Acts 1:12,) was a distance
limited and prescribed by <i>divine</i> authority? If Luke
could select the latter expression from the vocabulary of
<i>human tradition</i>, without intending to sanction it as being
of divine origin, could not John do the same with regard
to the former expression?</p>

<p>31. Do the Fathers, or any one of them, inform us
that the Lord's day was observed by <i>abstinence from labor</i>?&mdash;that
it was observed as the Sabbath? Mark the
question. It is not, was the day <i>observed</i>, simply; but,
was it observed <i>as the Sabbath</i>?</p>

<p>32. Is there not an important distinction between the
<i>Sabbath</i> and a <i>religious festival</i>? Does not the word
Sabbath mean <i>rest</i>? Can any day, therefore, be called
a Sabbath day, which is not a day of rest from ordinary
labor?</p>

<p>33. Does a religious <i>festival</i> require any thing more
than the commemoration of some important event, allowing
<span class="pagenum">{7-6}</span>
the time not occupied in the public celebration of it to
be spent in labor or amusement? Is not this precisely
the manner in which the first day of the week was observed,
according to the testimony of the ancient Fathers?</p>

<p>34. Though the observance of the first day of the week
as a religious festival be in itself innocent, (Rom. 14:5,) so
long as it is not made a pretext for dispensing with an express
law of God, (Matt. 15:6,) yet do you find it any
where in the word of God <i>commanded</i> as a <i>duty</i>?</p>

<p>35. Do you believe that a Sabbath, in the true and
proper sense of the term; namely, a day of rest from all
ordinary labor, is necessary and indispensable to the well-being
of mankind? If so, do you honestly suppose that
God would set it aside, and have its place supplied by
nothing more than a religious festival?</p>

<p>36. Is it not wicked to uphold a course which makes
the commandment of God of none effect? (Matt. 15:1-9;
Mark 7:1-13.)</p>

<p>Reader! carefully ponder the foregoing
questions, together with the Scripture references.
Answer them as you would if you
stood at the gates of death. Do not trifle
with the Holy Spirit of God, by forcibly
wresting his word from its obvious meaning.
Let conscience be unfettered; and act, as
fully realizing that "THOU, GOD, SEEST
ME."</p>

<h3>DIALOGUE,<br />
<span class="x-small">Between a Minister of the Gospel and a Sabbatarian</span></h3>

</div>

<p><i>Sabbatarian.</i> Did Jehovah ever sanctify one day above
another?</p>

<p><i>Minister.</i> He did.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> And what day was that?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> The seventh.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> When?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> When he finished his creative work.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Where?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> In Eden.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> On whom was it obligatory?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> On our first parents, and all their posterity.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Did he ever unsanctify that day?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Did he ever sanctify the first, or any other day
than the seventh, as a day of rest?</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Not that I know of.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Then do not those who neglect the seventh day,
take away something from the word of God? And do
not those who keep the first day add to that word? Read
the threatnings of the Lord against such:&mdash;"If any man
shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
plagues that are written in this book: and if any man
shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,
God shall take away his part out of the book of
life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which
are written in this book."</p>

<h3>COUNTERFEIT COIN.<br />
<span class="x-small">Being the substance of a recent Conversation between an eminent
Counsellor at Law and a Sabbatarian.</span></h3>

<p>The Lawyer contended that although the first day of
the week had no divine authority for its sanctity or observance
as a Sabbath, yet if it be kept as scrupulously
and conscientiously as the seventh day demanded, <i>it could
not but be</i> as acceptable to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{7-8}</span>
In answer to such sophistry, the Sabbatarian submitted
the following legal case to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am told that I can purchase, in the State of Connecticut,
<i>one hundred</i> copper cents, bearing the impress and
superscription of the United States Mint, and equal in
every respect in value to the mint coin, for <i>sixty-five</i> cents,
payable in gold or silver. But I admit them to be counterfeit.
I admit, also, that I circulate this spurious coin.
Now, will you undertake, for a fee of $10,000, to defend
my cause against a prosecution for passing such false
coin, and exonerate me from conviction in the United
States' Courts."</p>

<p>The honest lawyer's answer unhesitatingly was, "I
cannot argue your cause in the very teeth of so unquestionable
a law as appears to exist on the Statute Books."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sabbatarian replied:&mdash;"Then, as you admit <i>your
first day Sabbath a counterfeit</i>, allow me to answer you
as the celebrated Mr. Whiston did Chancellor King of
England upon a similar question: 'If God Almighty
should be as consistent, as just, and as jealous of his laws
in the Court of Heaven, as my Lord Chancellor is in his,
<i>where are we then</i>?'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Inference.</span>&mdash;If, then, I cannot obtain an advocate
on earth, (for no one of repute would undertake it,) to
plead my cause with the offer of a fee of $10,000, for the
violation of a law of man's making, what ground have I
to expect that the only advocate to be obtained in the
Court of Heaven, i. e. <i>the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, will defend
my cause against a breach of that law which his father
ever made punishable with <span class="smcap">death</span>, temporal and eternal?&mdash;and
who himself, when on earth, in his comment on
that law, averred that not one <i>jot</i> or <i>tittle</i> could in any
wise pass from it? (Matt. 5:18, 19.)</p>

<h2>SABBATH CONTROVERSY.<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE TRUE ISSUE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties which we who observe
the seventh day have ever found in the Sabbath controversy,
is to make our opponents understand what is the
real question at issue. So long have their thoughts,
feelings and habits, been moulded under one particular
view of the subject, that it seems almost a miracle if
one is found who can disregard all foreign matter, and
look at the precise point in debate long enough to
come to any certain and intelligent conclusion about it.
But it is evident, that if an opponent is suffered to raise
false issues, or to be continually striking off into the
discussion of some point which does not affect the final
question, we may prolong the controversy <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Let us then endeavor to state distinctly what is, and
what is not, the issue between us and the observers of
the first day of the week.</p>

<p>1. The issue is not whether the first day of the
week was observed at a very early period by Christians.
We admit that it was. We admit that its observance
may be traced up to very near the borders of the apostolic
age. What more can a generous, conscientious
opponent, who scorns any other aid than what the truth
will give him, ask? He knows in his own soul that
this is the very utmost that can be produced from any
of his histories. Let him ransack his old musty volumes
all the way backward, till he fancies he can almost talk
to the "beloved disciple" face to face, and what more
can he find? Verily, nothing.</p>

<p>But when you have got this admission from us, then
we have another question to ask. <i>How</i>&mdash;don't dodge
the question&mdash;HOW was the day observed by the early
Christians? We admit the observance of it; but that
is not the issue. The issue respects the <i>manner</i> of
observing it. You, if you are consistent, will say that
<span class="pagenum">{8-2}</span>
the early Christians observed it not only by public worship,
but by <i>abstaining from labor</i>. We, on the other
hand, deny that they abstained from labor. We admit
that they held public worship; but&mdash;we repeat it&mdash;<i>we
deny that they abstained from labor</i>. We deny that
they regarded it as a <i>Sabbath</i>, "resting according to
the commandment." Now with the issue thus fairly
stated, we put the laboring oar into your hands, and
challenge you to prove your position. Bring proof, if
you can, that the early Christians regarded the first day
of the week as any thing else than a <i>religious festival</i>;
between which and a <i>Sabbath</i> there is a very important
difference, the latter requiring abstinence from labor, the
former merely requiring public worship in honor of the
event commemorated, and allowing the remainder of
the day to be spent in labor or amusement.</p>

<p>2. When it is once settled, that in a very early period
of the church the first day was observed as a festival;
when our opponents have fairly jaded themselves to a
"weariness of the flesh," in their "much study" of the
old fathers, to find proof of it;&mdash;though we never called
it in question;&mdash;then the issue is, whether this festival
was <i>ordained</i> by <i>Christ</i>?&mdash;whether the New Testament
furnishes <i>inspired example</i> of such festival? Our opponents
affirm; we deny. We maintain that in every
passage of the New Testament, where the first
day of the week is mentioned, the context furnishes
a sufficient reason why it is mentioned, without
the least necessity of supposing it to have been a
festival season. No exception can be made to this,
unless in regard to 1&nbsp;Cor. 16:2. The reason why the
Apostle in this place specifies the first, rather than any
other day of the week, does not so clearly appear from
the context; but the peculiar phraseology employed,
"let each one of you lay by him," [himself,] is against
the idea of any public meeting; and if no public meeting,
of course no festival season. As every allusion
to the first day of the week is sufficiently explained by
<span class="pagenum">{8-3}</span>
other circumstances noticed in the context, the <i>inferential</i>
proof of its festival character is thereby destroyed.
As for <i>clear</i>, <i>positive</i> proof of it, such as express precept
or command, no person of modesty pretends it. Still
less is there any proof of its <i>Sabbatic</i> character.</p>

<p>3. Another point wherein we are necessarily at issue
with great numbers of Christians, is whether the <i>institution</i>
of the Sabbath is separable from the particular
<i>day</i> to be observed. They affirm; we deny. We maintain
that God's blessing and sanctifying a particular day
is the very thing in which the institution consists. To
render this plain matter yet more plain, we invite close
attention to the wording of the fourth commandment;
premising, however, that the word Sabbath is not <i>translated</i>
from a Hebrew word, but is the Hebrew word itself
anglicized, just as baptism is an anglicized Greek
word. The proper translation of the word is <i>Rest</i>.
Now let the word Rest be substituted for Sabbath, and
how clear it becomes&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Remember the Rest day to keep it holy.</i>" [Surely
some particular day is denoted; for it is <span class="smcap">the</span> Rest day,
not <span class="smcap">a</span> Rest day.] <i>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all
thy work; but the seventh day is the Rest of the Lord
thy God.</i> [Is it any where historically recorded as a fact
that God rested on <span class="smcap">the</span> seventh day? It is Gen. 2:2.
'On the seventh day God rested from, all his work which
he had made.' Who does not see that that day on which
God rested, was the <i>last</i> of the seven which constituted
the first week of time?] <i>In it</i>&mdash;[in <span class="smcap">what</span>? why, in the
seventh day, the last day of the week; for the pronoun
<i>it</i> can have no other antecedent]&mdash;<i>thou shalt not do
any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor
the stranger that is within thy gates.</i> [<span class="smcap">Why</span> must no
work be done on that particular day, the seventh or last
day of the week? The reason follows.] <i>For in six
days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all
that in them is, and</i> RESTED <i>on the seventh day</i>, [as
<span class="pagenum">{8-4}</span>
the record in Gen. 2:2 proves. See also Heb. 4:4.]
<i>Wherefore the Lord blessed the Rest day and sanctified
it.</i></p>

<p>The conclusion is irresistible, that the Rest day spoken
of is the particular day on which God rested from
his work, which, as before shown, was the last day of
the week. That very day, and no other, God blessed and
sanctified. The only reason assigned <i>why</i> he sanctified
it, is "because that in it he had rested from all his
work which God created and made." Gen. 2:3. The
Rest day, then, which we are required to observe, is
"the Rest of the Lord thy God:" which does not mean
the rest which the Lord thy God has appointed, though
it is true that he has appointed it; nor does it mean a
rest which becomes the Lord's by reason of our appropriating
it to him; but "the rest of the Lord thy God"
means <span class="smcap">the rest which the Lord thy God observed</span>.</p>

<p>Now from all this we think it must be evident, that
whoever observes any other Rest day than the seventh
day of the week, does not observe the Rest&mdash;Sabbath&mdash;"of
the Lord thy God." He may, it is true, appropriate
it to the Lord his God, and in that sense call it
the Lord's; he may ignorantly suppose that Christ in the
Gospel has appointed it, and in that sense also call it
the Lord's; but it can by no means be called "the
Rest of the Lord thy God" in the sense of that expression
in the fourth commandment. Hence, irresistible
is our conviction, that he does not obey the commandment.
O brother Christian, why will you persist in
maintaining that your Sunday keeping is an act of
obedience to the law of the Sabbath?</p>

<h2>THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.<br />
<span class="x-small">FALSE EXPOSITION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Fourth Commandment has been variously expounded
by its professed friends. Among these expositions,
none has been more injurious than that which
represents it as requiring the observance, not of <i>the</i>
Sabbath, and <i>the</i> seventh day, but of <i>a</i> Sabbath, and <i>a</i>
seventh day&mdash;not of a certain and well-known time, but
of an uncertain and varying time. Yet this is the exposition
of it which is given both by commentators and
writers on the subject of the Sabbath. It will be found,
however, that this view is generally presented in order
to prepare the way to introduce the first day of the week,
under the specious name of Lord's Day, into the place of
the Sabbath. Thus some are made to think, that the
name Sabbath may as well be applied to the first day of
the week as to the seventh. But to such an exposition
there are several serious objections:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It is a perversion of the original text itself. In
every place where the weekly Sabbath and the seventh
day are spoken of, the Hebrew article is uniformly used.
This article is often used like our demonstrative <i>this</i>&mdash;but
more commonly like our definite article <i>the</i>&mdash;never
as our indefinite article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>; and <i>Gesenius</i>,
in answer to the question whether it may be used <i>indefinitely</i>,
says, "The definite article cannot be rightly
said to stand indefinitely." To this opinion agree all
our translators, both ancient and modern, who have
rendered the terms, both in the fourth commandment
and all other places of the Scripture, by <i>the</i> Sabbath
and <i>the</i> seventh day.</p>

<p>2. It makes the Fourth Commandment to be indefinite
and absurd. If that commandment only requires
<span class="pagenum">{9-2}</span>
the observance of <i>a</i> Sabbath or <i>rest</i>, and that on <i>a</i> seventh
day, then one man might keep the seventh day, another
the third day, and another the fifth day, yet all obey the
commandment. What confusion would thus result from
carrying out this exposition to its legitimate results!
But God's commandment is not yea and nay after this
manner. It says, "<i>the</i> seventh day is <i>the</i> Sabbath of the
Lord thy God." That man will not be held guiltless
who misinterprets and misrepresents it, for however pious
a purpose he may do so.</p>

<p>3. It is contrary to the teachings of the very men
who give this exposition; for they affirm, that the fourth
commandment required the keeping of <i>the</i> seventh day
until Christ came. Now, if the Jews before Christ,
were bound to keep a certain and definite day, and that
<i>the</i> seventh day, then the commandment required a
certain and definite day, and that <i>the</i> seventh day.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is evident, that those who
represent the fourth commandment as requiring the observance
of only <i>a</i> Sabbath, and that upon <i>some one</i> day of
the seven indefinitely, are guilty of a false exposition of
the commandment, and of handling the word of God deceitfully.
They make a plain passage of Scripture to
signify one thing for some thousands of years, and then
ever afterwards to signify another thing. Thus do they
make void the commandment of God, that they may
keep their own traditions.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to a consideration of some of the
<i>consequences</i> of this kind of exposition. Among these
we will mention only three.</p>

<p>1. It overturns all certainty in explaining the Scriptures.
If a man, in translating from a Latin or Greek
author, should pervert his author's meaning in this manner,
by using words in a different sense from that in
which they were intended, he would be cast out and
despised. But yet when a preacher represents the term
<i>the Sabbath</i> as meaning simply <i>a rest</i>, that so he may
call the first day of the week <i>a rest</i>, and therefore <i>the
<span class="pagenum">{9-3}</span>
Sabbath</i>, he deals worse with the Scriptures than the
translator just mentioned does with his profane author.
Instead, however, of being cast out and despised, his
speculations are allowed to go for truth. Thus unbelievers
are encouraged in their infidelity; and occasion
is given for them to say, that the Bible is interpreted by
its friends to mean just what they please to have it. It
is dangerous for men to use their wits thus to blind the
eyes of their fellows.</p>

<p>2. It abolishes the Lord's Sabbath, and makes the
Fourth Commandment to be a mere cipher. First, it
abolishes the Lord's Sabbath, because it teaches that
the observance of the seventh day, on which God rested
and which he introduced into the commandment as one
with the Sabbath, is not at all binding, but the day may
be spent in any kind of labor. Is not this to abolish
<i>the Lord's</i> Sabbath? Second, it makes the fourth commandment
a cipher, because it takes away the <i>time</i>,
which is the seventh day, and the <i>event commemorated</i>,
which is God's resting from his creative work. Now
read the commandment, as these expounders would
have it, bereft of the <i>time</i> and the <i>event commemorated</i>.
It then commands only <i>a rest</i>, without any precept or
example as to its length or frequency. One person,
therefore, may rest one hour in each day; another one
day in a month; and a third one month in a year; and
each may call this keeping the Sabbath. Does not this
make the fourth commandment a mere cipher?</p>

<p>3. It abuses God's Word, and misleads his people.
It abuses his word by representing that the Word
teaches what it does not teach, and that it fails to teach
what it attempts to teach. It misleads his people, on
one side, by pressing the fourth commandment to sustain
the first day of the week, which it says nothing
about, thus laying a yoke upon the people, requiring
them to observe a day, in regard to which they will
finally be asked, Who hath required this at your hands?
On the other side, it misleads the people, by encouraging
<span class="pagenum">{9-4}</span>
them to neglect a day which God hath sanctified;
and commanded them to keep holy.</p>

<p>Such are some of the consequences of this false exposition
of the fourth commandment. They affect both
the sabbatic institution itself, and those whose duty it is
to remember it. It is true that the persons who countenance
such expositions are called very zealous and
godly men; but this, instead of bettering the case, makes
it worse. If they were enemies to the commandment,
such things might be expected, and would be comparatively
unimportant; but that the wound should be inflicted
by its friends, aggravates the evil. There is occasion
to tremble for some religious teachers, who
profess great interest in the Sabbath, but who yet refuse to
hear the truth in regard to it. Some such there are,
who, if the truth be presented to them, instead of inquiring
if these things are so, imitate the Jews of old
who, when they were cut to the heart, gnashed on their
reprover with their teeth; and when they could endure
it no longer, "stoppped their ears, and ran
upon him with one accord." Such would do well to
inquire if they are not in this thing teaching error for
truth, and their own traditions for the commandments
of God.</p>

<h3 class="small">INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

</div>

<p>Having often been solicited to give an account
of my conversion from the observance of what is
commonly called the Lord's Day, or Sunday, to the
observance of the ancient Sabbath of Jehovah, the
seventh day of the week, I submit this brief narrative
to public notice, not so much for the justification
of my present practice, as in the hope that it
may be the means of leading many other Christian
people candidly to examine this subject, which, as
it appears to me, is very essential to the restoration
of primitive Christianity. The narrative derives
its importance, not from the person of the narrator,
but from the practical exhibition which it furnishes
of the working of divine truth upon the mind.</p>

<div class="frontm">

<p><span class="pagenum">{10-3}</span></p>

<p>THE TRUE SABBATH EMBRACED AND OBSERVED.<br /><br /></p>

</div>

<h3 class="small">EARLY PREPOSSESSIONS.</h3>

<p>My parents, and nearly all of my family connections,
being members of Baptist churches, or attached
to that denomination&mdash;and I having been a
member of the same for above twenty-five years,
and more than half that time an accredited minister
among them&mdash;all my preferences and prepossessions
were with their peculiarities as churches
of the Lord Jesus Christ. If there was one characteristic
doctrine of the Baptists which I esteemed
above another, it was this: "We believe that the
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were
given by the inspiration of God, and are a perfect
rule of faith and practice." I could say with the
Psalmist, "My heart standeth in awe of thy word;
for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy
name."</p>

<h3 class="small">MATURED ATTACHMENTS.</h3>

<p>I believed firmly, that if there was a Christian
people upon the earth who had kept the primitive
faith from the days of the apostles, and had never
symbolized with the errors of the church of Rome
in her idolatrous and adulterous course, that people
was the Baptist denomination. If there was any
thing in my religious privileges in which I gloried,
it was in thinking that I had never been deceived
by the working of that mystery of iniquity. I was
sensible that the Baptists had errors among them;
but I regarded them as the errors of fallible human
nature, and not as departures from the constitutional
doctrine and law of the Holy Scriptures&mdash;some
<span class="pagenum">{10-4}</span>
of them superinduced by an unwatchful and
familiar intercourse with our more erroneous Pedobaptist
brethren, and hence mediately, though not
directly, the effect of that great apostacy which was
predicted as to come and deceive all nations. Holding
these sentiments, I was ardently and conscientiously
attached to that denomination, as the most
scriptural people on earth. I did not doubt but
that I should remain united with them in time, in
death, and in eternal life.</p>

<h3 class="small">REGARD FOR SCRIPTURAL CHRISTIANITY.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding my prepossessions and attachments,
it has been my prevailing desire, from the
time of my conversion, to be a Scriptural Christian;
and since I became a teacher of others, I have felt
a growing sense of obligation to know and teach
the whole counsel of God aright. The words of the
Lord Jesus Christ to his disciples, saying, "Call
no man master," "Call no man father," have for
years been so deeply impressed upon my heart, that
I have scrupulously refused to call myself a Fullerite,
a Calvinist, an Armenian, or after any human
name. Although I have my preferences in reading
and approving the sentiments of great and good
men, the Bible alone is my creed book.</p>

<h3 class="small">FORMER SABBATH SENTIMENTS.</h3>

<p>My former Sabbath sentiments were formed according
to the Puritan model. While a child, I
learned Sutcliff's and Watts' Catechisms, in both
of which it is taught, that the ten commandments
are a rule of life to good men; and traditionally I
was taught, that the Sabbath was changed from
the seventh to the first day of the week in honor
<span class="pagenum">{10-5}</span>
of the resurrection of Christ; and I fully believed
this was confirmed by the various references to the
first day contained in the New Testament.</p>

<h3 class="small">DISTURBED ABOUT THE SABBATH.</h3>

<p>I was first disturbed about the Sabbath seven
years ago, when a brother sent me a tract upon the
subject, called the <i>Investigator</i>. I read it with considerable
interest, and was much perplexed in attempting
to satisfy myself with my own views, as I
went along in the perusal of it. I wished then,
that there had been something more explicit upon
the subject of the change of the day than what I
could find in the New Testament. Not questioning,
however, but that it was divinely changed, I
quieted, rather than satisfied, my mind with what I
supposed to be abundant apostolic example; and
I remarked, that if our Pedobaptist brethren could
produce from the Scriptures as clear examples of
infant baptism, as we could of keeping the first day
of the week for a Sabbath, I would admit its validity.
Although I would not dare to say so now,
then it sufficed to quiet my mind.</p>

<p>I had no farther solicitude upon the subject, until
about midsummer of 1843. At that time, as several
professors of religion of my acquaintance did
not regard the day as I thought the Lord's Day
ought to be regarded, I concluded to preach a sermon
upon the subject, and commenced preparing
one. I had then recently purchased Neander's
History of the Christian Religion and Church during
the First Three Centuries. I read this book
with much satisfaction, as the work of an able and
candid historian, who takes a philosophical view
of the events and circumstances of society which
operated to give character to those early ages of
<span class="pagenum">{10-6}</span>
church history. In the section on Christian Worship
and Festivals, I was surprised to find the following
statement, viz: "<span class="smcap">Opposition to Judaism</span> <i>introduced
the particular festival of Sunday</i> very early
indeed into the place of the Sabbath.... The
festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always
only a human ordinance; and it was far from
the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine
command in this respect&mdash;far from them, and from
the early apostolic church, to transfer the laws of
the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the
second century a false application of this kind had
begun to take place; for men appear by that time
to have considered laboring on Sunday as a sin."
I was the more surprised at this statement, as I
found Neander was not a Sabbath-keeper. He
takes the high-church ground, acknowledging the
right of the so-called apostolic or catholic church
to alter or ordain the rites of Christian worship;
which is indeed, the foundation principle of all
Papal, Puseyite, and Pedobaptist observances. I
saw clearly enough, that if Neander was right, I
had no better foundation for Sunday-keeping than
hierarchists have for their Easter, Ascension, and
Christmas Festivals, which I had always repudiated;
or than Pedobaptists have for sprinkling infants.
I therefore determined to give the subject</p>

<h3 class="small">A THOROUGH EXAMINATION.</h3>

<p>I commenced with human authors, and read
Fuller, Buck, Doddridge, Paley, Wilson, Humphrey,
Nevins, Kingsbury, Phelps, Whateley, and
others; and I was astonished to find every one of
them admitting, that there is no express command,
precept, or passage of Scripture, to authorize the
change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first
<span class="pagenum">{10-7}</span>
day of the week. They all attempt to support the
practice by inferences and analogical reasonings
from particular events. Not having veneration
large enough to bow to their great names and acute
reasonings, I was landed upon a lonely shore, without
pilot or compass, with no guide but the truthful
chart of Revelation. As I had often vowed in
my heart to the Lord, that I would be a Bible
Christian so far as I could discover the meaning
of the divine Word, or know the revealed will
of God; and had more than once told my Pedobaptist
friends, when accused of sectarianism, that
I would leave all for the truth's sake, if I could
discover that I was wrong; I was greatly perplexed,
for <i>I found a great fact</i>&mdash;The Sabbath was
changed. The greater part of the world, the most
estimable of Christians, do keep their weekly Sabbath
on the first day! Can they all be wrong? I
conversed with some, and found them more inconsistent
in their reasons than the authors I read.
For a time, to sanction the change of the Sabbath,
I took what may properly be called prelatical
ground. It may be stated as follows, viz: "The
thing exists; and in the New Testament we find
some things which appear to us so like it, that, we
conclude this and they are identical; though we
cannot find the particulars of the change. And
besides, we find some occurrences mentioned in the
New Testament which seemingly happened in accordance
with it and which afford reasons for it,
and so we think, they should be considered satisfactory
evidences of the change existing at the
time." But my confidence in this fact was overturned
by discovering <i>another great fact</i>, viz: That
the first day was not honored as a Sabbath during
the first two centuries of the Christian era; and
that when it did come to be so observed, it was not
<span class="pagenum">{10-8}</span>
on the considerations that are now alledged, but on
what appeared to me a wicked reason&mdash;mere spite
to the Jews. I therefore commenced anew,</p>

<h3 class="small">A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>

<p>But the more attentively I read it, with this
object in view, viz. to find out the mind of Christ
upon the subject of the Sabbath, the more plainly
I saw that it was against me. I found that Christ
and his apostles enjoined the observance of the
law of the ten commandments as holy, just, and good&mdash;that
law which says, "Remember the Sabbath
day to keep it holy, ... the seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God." I found, also, that
Christ had said, (Mark 2:27, 28,) "The Sabbath
was made for man; therefore the Son of Man is
Lord also of the Sabbath day"&mdash;plainly incorporating
it into the laws of his kingdom. Luke also says,
many years after the resurrection, writing the account
in his Gospel of that event, "The women
rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment"&mdash;thus
recognizing it, as it appeared to me,
to be a commandment still in force.</p>

<h3 class="small">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST.</h3>

<p>The Resurrection of Christ being regarded as
the great event which required the change in question,
I carefully considered that matter. But I no
where found it spoken of by the New Testament
writers, as it is by divines of modern times. The
only instance I could find of its celebration by the
apostles, was in the ordinance of baptism, in these
words, "If we have been planted together in the
likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness
of his resurrection." (Rom. 6:5.) And again,
"What shall they do which are baptized for the
<span class="pagenum">{10-9}</span>
[resurrection of the] dead, if the dead rise not at
all?" (1&nbsp;Cor. 15:29.) I concluded that there could
not be two apostolic ways of celebrating it; and
hence that I must look for some other reason to
justify the change in question.</p>

<h3 class="small">THE TIME OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST.</h3>

<p>I had always supposed that our Saviour rose on
the morning of the first day of the week, and had
no doubt about finding it plainly recorded that he
did. But when I searched for it in the evangelists,
I found the accounts very different from what I had
supposed. Matthew 28:1, reads, "In the end of
the Sabbath." Mark 16:1&mdash;"When the Sabbath
was passed." Matthew&mdash;"As it began to dawn
towards the first day of the week." Mark&mdash;"Very
early in the morning, the first day of the week."
Luke 24:1&mdash;"Very early in the morning." John
20:1&mdash;"Early, when it was yet dark, ... they
came to the sepulchre, and found not the body
of the Lord Jesus." As this did not tell the exact
time of his resurrection, I set myself to see if I
could find it by any other passages. On examination,
it appeared plain to me, that as he was buried
at sun-down, according to that law in Deut. 21:23,
to fulfill his own prediction, "So shall the Son of
man be three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth," his resurrection must have taken
place at the same hour of the day, or rather evening&mdash;which
would destroy its identity with the
first day as now reckoned, and carry back his
crucifixion to the fourth day of the week.</p>

<p>All we know of the time of the crucifixion, I
found to be, that it was on the fourteenth day of the
first month, the preparation day of the Passover
<span class="pagenum">{10-10}</span>
The fifteenth day was the Passover Sabbath, a high
day with the Jews. (See John 19:14, 31.)</p>

<p>If Jesus was thus crucified on the fourth day
of the week, I found that it made a striking correspondence
between the event and the prediction
in Daniel 9:7.</p>

<p>The reason why the Holy Spirit was poured out
on the day of <span class="smcap">Pentecost</span>, I found to be, because
it was the first annual national assembly after the
crucifixion&mdash;the Saviour being put to death at the
Passover, and Pentecost being fifty days after.
This event, therefore, had nothing to do with the
Sabbath.</p>

<h3 class="small">CHRIST'S APPEARANCES.</h3>

<p>The appearances of Christ to his disciples on the
first day of the week, are considered as good reasons
for sanctifying that day. It is supposed that
he so designed them. But these did not appear to
me as I expected, when I came to examine them
carefully, I knew them as related by the evangelists,
but I had them traditionally arranged and associated
to suit the arguments for keeping the first
day; and when I came to read them with an honest
inquiry after the truth, they appeared very different
from what I had supposed. I found that there
were five appearances of Christ to his disciples on
the first day following his resurrection; and neither
of them occurred when the disciples were assembled
for worship; neither were they accompanied
by any such direction.</p>

<p>His first appearance was to the four women, as
they returned from the sepulchre, where they had
been with spices to embalm the body of Jesus.
They were directed by an angel, and by Jesus
himself, to go and tell his disciples that Christ was
<span class="pagenum">{10-11}</span>
risen, and would meet them on a mountain in Galilee
as he had promised them before his crucifixion.
There was nothing in this like Sabbath-keeping!</p>

<p>The women having gone into the city, informed
Peter and John, who went immediately to the
sepulchre; and having looked in and satisfied themselves
that the report of the women was true, Peter
and John returned to the city. But Mary tarried
still at the sepulchre, weeping, when Jesus appeared
to her alone. (John 20:16.)</p>

<p>Next he appeared to Peter. (Luke 24:34,
1&nbsp;Cor. 15:5.)</p>

<p>Afterward he appeared to Cleopas and another
disciple as they journied to Emmaus. (Luke
24:13-35.)</p>

<p>At night, when they had retired for their evening
repast, Jesus appeared in the midst of them, and
partook with them of a piece of broiled fish and an
honey comb. (Luke 24:42.)</p>

<p>These were all on the first day of the week, and
they appeared to me conclusive evidence, that the
disciples had not yet received any intimations of a
change of Sabbath time, there being no evidence
of it in their conduct or discourse.</p>

<p>Eight days after this, Jesus appeared again to his
disciples, Thomas being with them. (John 20:26.)
After these things, he shewed himself again to
seven of his disciples as they were fishing at the
sea of Tiberius. (John 21:1-14.)</p>

<p>At another time, probably on the mountain in
Galilee, he was seen of five hundred brethren at
once. (1&nbsp;Cor. 15:6.)</p>

<p>After this, he was seen of James. (1&nbsp;Cor. 15:7.)</p>

<p>Then of the disciples when he was taken up into
heaven. (Luke 24:50, 51.)</p>

<p>Last of all, he was seen by Saul of Tarsus on his
way to Damascus. (1&nbsp;Cor. 15:8.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{10-12}</span>
There are eleven instances mentioned of his
meeting his disciples, and not one of them contains
a single reference to the Sabbath in any way whatever,
which fully convinced me that the pretence
of the Sabbath being changed at the resurrection
of Christ was wholly groundless. How any one,
without very strong prepossessions and blindness,
could think these things make a Sabbath, I could
not see. Only five of these instances are said to be
on the first day, and these were all private interviews!
Saul of Tarsus might as well conclude
that he ought to build a meeting-house where Jesus
met him, as for the disciples to make a Sabbath of
the first day because Jesus appeared to them on
that day. After examining these things, it looked
to me as though the Papists were quite as justifiable
for changing the second commandment to make an
image of Christ and his cross, as Protestants are
for altering the fourth commandment to honor the
resurrection. The Papists honor the crucifixion,
and the Protestants the resurrection.</p>

<h3 class="small">APOSTOLIC EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p>I looked for apostolic examples. But alas, they
all failed me. They did not afford me the evidences
I had supposed they would. I found but
one account of a Christian assembly on the first
day of the week, which was at Troas; and that
was an evening meeting, and a parting meeting
which Paul held with his friends; and while he
was holding that meeting, seven of his companions
in travel went and removed the ship in which they
were to sail from Troas to Assos, whither he followed
them on foot to go aboard. I thought, Could
they be keeping Sabbath in so doing? (See Acts
20:1-14.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{10-13}</span>
"<i>The Lord's Day</i>," I found mentioned but once
in the New Testament, (Rev. 1:10,) and there
it does not tell what day of the week it was on,
so that I judged it certainly must favor that day
for which there is both Bible command and example,
rather than that day for which there is nothing
but custom and tradition. Thus it appeared
to me, that all apostolic example was not only
against the observance of the first day, but clearly
in favor of the seventh; for I found that at Antioch
in Pisidia, the Apostle observed the Sabbath with
both Jews and Gentiles. (Acts 13:14, 42, 44.)
The same at Philippi. (Acts 16:13.) And at
Thessalonica. (Acts 17:2, 3.) Also at Corinth,
where the Apostle continued a year and six months,
he observed <span class="smcap">every</span> Sabbath day. (Acts 18:4, 11.)</p>

<p><i>The law of God</i>, with all its awful sanctions,
flaming from Mount Sinai, appeared to me to
threaten my destruction if I dared to reject any
part of its holy claims, for when I read what
Jesus said, (Luke 16:17,) "It is easier for
heaven and earth to pass than for one tittle of the
law to fail," I could not entertain a doubt but
that it was obligatory upon his disciples.</p>

<h3 class="small">THE DECISION.</h3>

<p>These things greatly distressed me, and in the
end separated me from Sunday-keeping forever.
At this time I was not acquainted with a single
seventh-day Christian. But a bookseller sent me
some copies of the "Address of the Seventh-day
Baptists to the Baptists of the United States,"
which was peculiarly opportune to my state of
mind. It showed me the inconsistency of Sunday-keeping
with all the foundation principles of the
<span class="pagenum">{10-14}</span>
faith I had received, and the order I had observed;
and served to bring me to a decision. Yet I did
not dare to submit my mind at once to the force
of truth, until I had repeatedly investigated every
Scripture passage and event on which I had formerly
relied for a justification of my faith. I endeavored
to do this as independently of extrinsic considerations
as I could; and each time brought me
to the same conclusion. I could find no Scripture
authority for a first-day Sabbath. Yet the conflict
was not over. I suffered for some time that deep
mental anguish which attends a conscientious mind,
where enlightened judgment conflicts with all the
inclinations, expectations, and kindliest associations
of life. If ever an anxious mariner sailed tremblingly
between Sylla and Charybdis, surely his
condition was like mine at this time. To advocate
the Sunday observance without Bible authority, I
could not for conscience's sake. To embrace the
no-Sabbath doctrine, I dared not; this was too dark
and downward a leap from the highway of holiness
for me to hazard; and the former was too disloyal
and dishonest a course for me to pursue in the
name of the King of saints. For a time I indulged
a forlorn hope, that I might find some way of reconciling
the matter so as to appear consistent
without leaving the denomination. But accustomed
to speak the honest sentiments of my heart, I
found the subject naturally influencing my prayers
and my preaching, and in other ways embarrassing
me, so that it became a burden I knew not how to
bear. I commenced keeping the Sabbath alone in
my study. It seemed now as if God had shut me
up to my own vows; <i>I was compelled to renounce all</i>
for his truth, or prove apostate to the principles of
godliness! Dark indeed appeared my prospects.
I had a wife and eight children to support, and no
<span class="pagenum">{10-15}</span>
human resource to look to but my salary. I felt,
too, for the reputation, sentiments, and prepossessions
of my wife and children, some of whom had
already made a profession of religion, and for many
other young converts recently gathered into the
church of which I was pastor. But just at that
time, I was called to baptize a young woman who
had to leave father and mother, and brothers and
sisters, and all she had on earth, for her faith in
Christ. This greatly assisted me to determine to
do so too.</p>

<p>The decision gave great relief to my mind. I
could now with more confidence appeal to our
Father in heaven for support and direction. I
could with great comfort appropriate many precious
promises of God's Word to my own case,
and find them a precious cordial to my soul.
Never have I found more enjoyment in divine
things than since I thus renounced all for Christ.
I found as the Psalmist expresses it, that "great
peace have they that love thy law, and nothing
shall offend them." "O taste and see that the
Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusteth in
him."</p>

<h3 class="small">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>The result has been happy in my own family.
All in my house who have come to years of discretion
have since united in walking according to
the commandments. Although it was not easy at
first to throw off early prepossessions, we have
found no embarrassments from them since the decision
was made. Many things which we feared
have proved imaginary, and all necessary good has
been added unto us; and the truth of God has
more abounded toward us. Thus will it be with
all them that obey God. "All his commandments
<span class="pagenum">{10-16}</span>
are sure." "No good thing will he withhold from
him that walketh uprightly." Its influence upon
my religious feelings, and views of divine truth in
general, has been to clear up some things that were
previously obscure, and give a beautiful harmony
to the requirements of the law and the doctrines
of the Gospel. My hope is, when Babylon shall
fall, to be found among them who keep the commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus. (Rev.
14:12.)</p>

<p>THE APPEAL.</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>We fully agree with you in the popular sentiment
of our nation, that liberty is sweet&mdash;to men
of noble minds, much more precious than estates,
or treasures of silver and gold&mdash;dearer than our
reputation and honor among the despots of the
world. Was it not this sentiment, firmly-rooted in
the minds of the Fathers of our National Independence,
which led them to stake their "lives, their
fortunes, and their sacred honor," rather than be
the serfs of a British King and his aristocratic Lords?
Applauding their spirit, we know that you will
agree with us in the sentiment, that the preservation
of that liberty which they achieved and perpetuated
in our ever-glorious Constitution, is the
highest civil duty which we owe to ourselves, to our
posterity, and to our nation. All but coercionists
will agree with us, that the preservation of our religious
liberty is a sacred duty, which we owe alike to
the cause of truth and our political happiness.</p>

<p>Give us your candid attention, then, while we
present a brief statement of the wrongs we are
suffering in these United States, despite the principles
of the National Declaration of Independence,
and the guarantees of our National Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{11-4}</span>
Believing in the integrity of the provisional Government
which made the Declaration of Independence,
our fathers and predecessors in faith, fought
side by side with yours for the liberty which that
instrument declares to be the inalienable right
of all men. They were equally zealous parties to
the adoption of the Constitution of the United
States&mdash;that Constitution which says there shall
be "no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" "and the
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
thing in the constitution or laws of any State to
the contrary notwithstanding." Although our brethren
at Ephrata, in Pennsylvania, regarded warfare
and the shedding of blood as inconsistent with the
Christian profession, yet they were no less ardent
admirers of those national instruments by which
American liberties were asserted and established.
Of this they gave ample proof, in the unwavering
support which they ever voluntarily rendered to the
National Government and its troops, by all the
peaceable means at their command. History records
an act of patriotism and piety, which reflects
everlasting honor on their names. They voluntarily
and compassionately received, at their establishment,
between four and five hundred wounded
Americans who had fallen in the battle of Brandywine,
fed them from their own stores, and nursed
them with their own hands, for which they never
received nor asked a recompense of the American
Government or people. It was enough for them,
that they were their fellow men. But it stirred
their hearts the deeper, that they knew they were
bleeding in the cause of sacred liberty.</p>

<p>We are the descendants and successors in faith
of these parties. We hold the same sentiments,
and cherish the same principles, which they did at
<span class="pagenum">{11-5}</span>
that time. Is it not surprising, then, that within
seventy years after the signing of that Declaration,
and in little more than half a century after the
adoption of the Constitution, the lineal descendants
of these parties, and their successors in faith and
principles, should have their liberties so abridged
by state authorities, as to give occasion for an appeal
to the citizens of the whole nation, from
whom the sovereign power emanates, for a redress
of their wrongs? But so it is. Religious zealots,
in our State Legislatures and on the Judicial Bench,
have violated the Constitution of the nation, established
an article of their religious creed, and made
it penal for others of different sentiments to follow
out their own honest convictions of duty to God.
The consequence is, that eight of our brethren are
at this moment under judicial sentence for their religious
sentiments, and condemned to pay four dollars
each, with costs of prosecution, or suffer imprisonment
in the common jail. It is not pretended
that they have injured the persons, or wronged the
estates or interests of any of their fellow-citizens.
Neither is it pretended that they are lewd or intemperate
persons, or profaners of churches. The
only pretence is, that they have injured the religious
feelings of some others by peaceably working
upon their own farms on the first day of the
week, in obedience to the dictates of their own consciences
and the law of God. And this is the second
time, within the space of one year, that the persecution
of these otherwise unoffending men, has
been approved by the courts of Pennsylvania. In
four other States of the Union, in defiance of the
National Constitution, our fellow-citizens have
suffered prosecutions, fines, and imprisonment,
within the past year, upon similar charges. Beside
this, in the States where toleration is provided
<span class="pagenum">{11-6}</span>
for labor on our own farms and in our own work
shops on the first day of the week, all contracts,
legal and commercial transactions, if done even
among ourselves, are declared null and void by the
State Statutes. So that, even in these States, we
are deprived of our constitutional and inalienable
right to use one-sixth part of our time for commercial,
legal, and judicial transactions; and then
are tied up to our own premises, as though we were
as dangerous to the religious interests of our fellow-citizens,
as rabid animals are to their persons.</p>

<p>Applications were made to three State Legislatures
during the winter of 1845-6, for relief from
these odious statutes. But those applications were
all repulsed with supercilious denials. Forbearance
is no longer a virtue. A succession of abuses
and usurpations of our rights, has compelled us
to take measures to resist, with all the legal means
in our power, and with all that we can honorably
acquire, whatever laws abridge the rights or coerce
the consciences of ourselves or our fellow-citizens
on religious or sectarian considerations. Appealing
to Jehovah and his holy law for the rectitude
of our principles and the righteousness of our
cause, we have implored, and shall continue to implore,
the interposition of his Providence to succeed
our efforts.</p>

<p>Without wishing to disturb the peace of society,
or wantonly to overturn the existing order of things,
but actuated solely by a sense of duty to maintain
the integrity of God's law, and preserve unimpaired
our religious privileges, we appeal to you, fellow-citizens,
in defence of the justice of our demands,
by a fair representation of our Constitutional Rights.</p>

<p>The sixth article of the Constitution of the
United States, section 2d, says, "This Constitution,
and the laws of the United States which shall be
<span class="pagenum">{11-7}</span>
made in pursuance thereof, ... shall be the
supreme law of the land; and the judges in every
State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution
or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>

<p>Section 3d says, "The members of the several
State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial
officers, both of the United States and of the several
States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation
to support this Constitution; but no religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification to office or
public trust under the United States."</p>

<p>In the amendments to the Constitution, article
1st, it is written, "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof."</p>

<p>In view of these sections of the fundamental
law of the nation, what can be more palpably unconstitutional
than those State statutes which are
so framed as to declare and establish the first day
of the week as "the Christian Sabbath," or holy
day. The State statutes which subject any citizen
to fine or imprisonment for labor, or any legal transaction,
on the first day of the week, as far as their
influence extends, make void God's everlasting
law, and subject the conscientious servant thereof
to punishment for a strict conformity to it. The
State statutes violate the Constitution of the United
States in two respects. 1st. They violate that part
of the Constitution which forbids the enactment
of any "law respecting an establishment of religion;"
because by them the religious observance
of the first day is made a State establishment of religion
as really and arbitrarily as the law of Constantine
made it a part of the religion of the Roman
Empire. 2d. They violate that part of the
Constitution which forbids the making of any law
<span class="pagenum">{11-8}</span>
"prohibiting the free exercise" of religion; because,
by forbidding labor on the first day of the week,
they prohibit a strict conformity to the law of God
which says, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all
thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God." With this view of the subject,
we submit it to the common-sense of candid men
to say, if every judicial officer who convicts or
passes sentence upon his fellow-citizens for disobeying
these arbitrary statutes on a charge of
Sabbath-breaking, is not a perjured man. He
swears or affirms to "support the Constitution of
the United States, any thing in the Constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding;"
yet he administers a law which establishes a sectarian
article of religion, and punishes conscientious
men for a free exercise of their own religious opinions,
and for doing what they esteem to be their
duty to God.</p>

<p>Heretofore we have asked only for exemptions
from these odious statutes for all such as observe
the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and we
have generally been permitted to pass peaceably
along. But of late our growing numbers, and our
increasing influence in the nation, together with
the use of the public press in defence of our sentiments,
have seemingly made us too odious in the
eyes of some of our fellow-citizens to be suffered
peaceably to enjoy our lights. Powerful efforts
are being made to inflame the public mind against
us, to influence the magistracy to enforce the Sunday
laws now existing, and if possible to procure
the enactment of others more stringent and restrictive.
These things have thrown us unavoidably
upon our constitutional rights. Experience
teaches us that our peace and liberty are continually
jepordized by the existence of statutes which
<span class="pagenum">{11-9}</span>
can be so construed as to coerce us, contrary to
our consciences, to do reverence to the first day of
the week as a holy day. We therefore demand the
entire repeal of all laws for coercing the observance
of the first day, as being contrary to the spirit
and the letter of the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>The view which we take of this subject is not
from a partial construction of the Constitution.
That instrument has been so construed by impartial
and competent authority. The following extract
from a letter written by <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>,
while President of the United States, and who was
President of the Convention for framing the Constitution,
to a committee of a Baptist Society in
Virginia, in answer to an application to him for his
views of the meaning and efficiency of that instrument
to protect the rights of conscience, decides
the intent of the framers of the Constitution, and
consequently the intent of the Constitution itself.
The letter is dated August 4, 1789, and reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"If I had the least idea of any difficulty resulting from the
 Constitution adopted by the Convention of which I had the honor to be
 President when it was formed, so as to endanger the rights of any
 religious denomination, then I never should have attached my name to
 that instrument. If I had any idea that the General Government was so
 administered that liberty of conscience was endangered, I pray you be
 assured that no man would be more willing than myself to revise and
 alter that part of it, so as to avoid all religious persecution. You
 can, without doubt, remember that I have often expressed my opinion,
 that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable
 alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in
 worshiping God according to the dictates of his conscience.</p>

The Congressional Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads, to whom were referred certain
memorials for prohibiting the transportation of
mails and the opening of post offices on Sunday,
in the 43d session of Congress, A. D. 1830, reported
unfavorably to the prayer of the memorialists.
Their report was adopted and printed by order of
the Senate of the United States, and the Committee
was discharged from the farther consideration of the
subject. That Committee take the same view of the
intent of the Constitution as did General Washington.
They say:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"We look in vain to that instrument for authority to say whether
 first day, or seventh day, or whether any day, has been made holy by
 the Almighty." ... "The Constitution regards the conscience of the
 Jew as sacred as that of the Christian; and gives no more authority
 to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual,
 than that of a whole community. That representative who would violate
 this principle, would lose his delegated character, and forfeit the
 confidence of his constituents. If Congress should declare the first
 day of the week holy, it would not convince the Jew nor the
 Sabbatarian. It would dissatisfy both, and consequently convert
 neither." ... "If a solemn act of legislation shall in one point
 define the law of God, or point out to the citizen one religious
 duty, it may with equal propriety define every part of revelation,
 and enforce every religious obligation, even to the forms and
 ceremonies of worship, the endowments of the church, and the support
 of the clergy." ... "The framers of the Constitution recognized the
 eternal principle, that man's relation to his God is above human
 legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was
 not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our
 own bosoms. It is this consciousness which, in defiance of human
 laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and flames. They felt
 that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man
 could exercise no authority over their consciences. It is an inborn
 principle, which nothing can eradicate." ... "It is also a fact, that
 counter memorials, equally respectable, oppose the interference of
 Congress, on the ground that it would be legislating upon a religious
 subject, and therefore unconstitutional."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{11-11}</span>
Impartial Judiciaries have taken the same view
of these provisions of the Constitution, and have
declared the laws enforcing the observance of the
first day of the week unconstitutional, as may be
seen in Judge Herttell's book, "The Rights of the
People Reclaimed;" also in "An Essay on Constitutional
Reform, by Hiram P. Hastings, Counselor
at Law."</p>

<p>On the 2d of October, 1799, at New Mills, Burlington
County, New Jersey, a Seventh-day Baptist
being indicted before a Justice of the Peace for
working on Sunday, and fined, he appealed. At
the trial in Court, the foregoing letter from General
Washington was produced by the Judge, and read
in his charge to the Jury. The result was acquittal
by the Jury.</p>

<p>In the year 1845, the Court of Hamilton County,
Ohio, made a similar decision in a like case, and on
similar considerations.</p>

<p>A Committee of the Common Hall of the City of
Richmond, Virginia, to whom was referred the case
of certain persecuted Jews, have made a like decision
on the municipal laws of that City, which
have been construed to enforce keeping the first day.</p>

<p><i>The Post Office Laws</i> are framed in accordance
with these provisions of the Constitution. The Act
of March 3d, 1825, section 1st, authorizes the Postmaster
to "provide for the carriage of the mail on
all post roads that are or may be established by law,
and as often as he, having regard to the productiveness
thereof, and other circumstances, shall think
proper." Section 17th provides, "that every Postmaster
shall keep an office, in which one or more
persons shall attend on every day on which a mail
shall arrive by land or water, as well as on other
days, at such hours as the Postmaster General shall
direct, for the purpose of performing the duties
<span class="pagenum">{11-12}</span>
thereof; and it shall be the duty of the Postmaster,
at all reasonable hours, on every day of the week,
to deliver on demand any letter, paper, or packet,
to the person entitled to, or authorized to receive
the same." The laws against labor on the first day,
in each State where they exist, are obliged to except
the mail-carriers and the postmasters. But we
ask our fellow-citizens to consider by what show
of justice, any local tribunal can punish a private
citizen for doing that on his own account, which the
servants and officers of the United States are doing
at the same time, for the use of the people, and by
a law of the same Government? Suppose a carriage
conveying the United States Mail, should enter
the City of Philadelphia on Sunday; and another
carriage, containing goods or wares for the next
day's market, should enter at the same time and by
the same route; with what show of justice shall the
driver of the market carriage be put under arrest
and fined, and the driver of the mail carriage go
free? Or suppose there should be a postmaster
assorting his letters on the first day, and a fellow-citizen
selling pens, ink, paper, and wafers, to write
the same letters, in another part of the same building;
with what show of justice shall the tradesman
be fined and the postmaster go free? The officers
of the United States Government have no national
rights above the humblest citizen. The transgression
of law by them is as really a crime as in the
case of any other citizen. Our Government knows
nothing of those kingly rights which set emperors,
monarchs, and their servants, above law. If, therefore,
there is no transgression of constitutional law
in carrying the United States Mail on the first day,
then there is none in a private citizen following his
otherwise lawful and peaceable occupation on the
same day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{11-13}</span>
In some quarters, during the last year, our motives
and designs were grossly misrepresented by
prejudiced persons, in our legislatures and elsewhere.
We were represented as "wishing the legislature
to change the Sabbath from the first to the
seventh day of the week;" and were accused of
"covertly wishing to compel our fellow-citizens to
keep our Sabbath day." No insinuation could be
more grossly deceptive&mdash;no accusation more flagitiously
unjust to us as a people. We declare unequivocally,
that we do not desire any such thing.
We believe that keeping the Sabbath day is purely
a religious duty. All we ask is, that our State Legislatures
leave the matter where the Constitution
of the United States and the laws of the General
Government have placed it. They have no more
right to determine this religious duty, than they
have to determine the rites of Christian worship.
We believe our fellow-citizens ought to be protected
in the peaceable observation of their day of religious
rest, as in the observance of every other religious
institution, except where such observance is
made a sanctuary for crime. We ask the same
protection for ourselves on the seventh day of the
week, and nothing more.</p>

<p>If the Constitution may be infringed upon to put
down the observers of the seventh day, no one can
say how long it will be before other minor denominations
may be put down too. Already attempts
are making to exact a confession of faith, unknown
to the Constitution, as a qualification for a legal
oath. If the religious sanctification of the first day
of the week may be enforced by statutory requirements,
so may the forms and hours of worship.
He who says, that there is no danger of the latter
being enforced, while statutory regulations violate
two of the most sacred provisions of the National
<span class="pagenum">{11-14}</span>
Constitution, knows but little of the history of mankind,
or pays but little attention to the tendencies
of human nature. A single standing violation of
the Constitution is an example and an authority for
others to follow. One religious observance established
by law, is the admission of the main principle
of national hierarchy, and will come in time to
be referred to as authority for similar infractions
of the Constitution. The laws for the observance
of the first day are in fact a union of Church and
State. It is not pretended that they are designed
to subserve directly a political or civil object. It
is altogether a religious object which they subserve.
It becomes every friend of equal rights, as he loves
the Constitution of his country, to oppose these infractions
of its just principles, until equal liberty is
secured to all citizens by statutory provisions, as by
the fundamental laws of the nation.</p>

<p>Our opponents often remind us of their pretence,
that we are under no more restrictions than other
citizens; we may do as we please about keeping
the seventh day. To this we reply, that the tyrants
of the Roman people deprived the Republic of its
liberties by professing themselves the guardians of
their <span class="smcap">interests</span>. "By declaring themselves the
protectors of the people, Marius and Cæsar had
subverted the Constitution of their country." Augustus
established a despotism by artfully affecting
to be governed himself by the same laws which he
procured to be enacted to take away the rights
of the people. These are the same principles upon
which religious coercionists conjure us to be quiet
under the loss of our constitutional rights. The
progress of these things towards despotism is as
dangerous in the American Republic as in that of
Rome, and may be as rapid. Their success would
be as deadly to human happiness, and all the best
<span class="pagenum">{11-15}</span>
interests of mankind, in the nineteenth century, as
they were in the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire. Human nature now affords no better
guaranty for the safety of <i>our</i> national rights, than
it did to the Romans at the summit of their greatness.
Liberty can be preserved only at the expense
of perpetual vigilance, and by the popular
support of individual rights. If ever the doctrine
which has been urged before one of our legislative
bodies, "The greatest good of the greatest number,"
should become a popular political axiom, to
justify the course of the many in taking away the
rights of the few, the halls of legislation will become
scaffolds for the execution of liberty, and
that odious principle will be the shroud in which it
will be buried. Despots may establish a round of
religious observances, and exact an unwilling and
insincere conformity to their arbitrary prescriptions;
but they can never convince the understanding nor
win the heart of one who knows the voice of truth.
They can only make him a slave, while the effects
of their arbitrary prescriptions on the popular mind
will be to wither up all interest in the religious
tendencies of an observance sustained only by the
enactments of heartless politicians. All that makes
religion vital and effective for its own holy objects,
expires when the sword is drawn to enforce it.
Liberty, humanity, religion, and our National Constitution,
then, require that the laws enforcing the
observance of the first day of the week should be
repealed.</p>

<p>As American Citizens, as independent Freemen,
and as responsible Stewards of the glorious heritage
bequeathed to us by the Fathers of the Revolution,
we shall, with the aid of the Majesty of
Heaven, maintain unimpaired the high privileges
secured to us by the Charter of our Liberties.
<span class="pagenum">{11-16}</span>
We ask for no exclusive immunities. We disclaim
all right of human government to exercise
over, or fetter in the least, the religious rights of
any being. Might is not right, neither does the accident
of being a <i>majority</i> give any, claim to trample
on the rights of the minority. It is a usurpation
of authority to oppress the minority, or set at
naught their indefeasible rights. In civil affairs we
respect the authorities that be, but in religious service,
resent being forced to keep the commandments
of men. We recognize the laws of the land
in all secular matters, and the laws of God, and of
God alone, in religious faith and practice. These
are the inalienable rights of all the members of a
Republic. These are rights reserved by the people
to themselves, in the formation of our Government,
which no power can legitimately wrest from
us, and with the help of God none shall.</p>

<h2>MISUSE OF THE TERM "SABBATH"</h2>

</div>

<p>It is quite common, in these days, to hear the
term <i>Sabbath</i> used to designate the first day of the
week or Sunday. But such a use of the term is
not only unscriptural, but calculated to mislead the
people. Throughout the Bible, there is but one
sacred day of weekly occurrence called the Sabbath,
and that is the seventh or last day of the
week. When, therefore, men talk about a <i>Christian</i>
Sabbath, and a <i>Jewish</i> Sabbath&mdash;a <i>first-day</i>
Sabbath, and a <i>seventh-day</i> Sabbath&mdash;that so they
may slily fix the term Sabbath upon the first day,
and then persuade people that all those texts of
Scripture which speak of the Sabbath day are
meant of the first day, they pursue a course which
is unauthorized, and deserve to be sharply rebuked.
There are circumstances, however, which many
persons seem to regard as justifying the common
practice of calling the first day by the name <i>Sabbath</i>.
Let us examine some of them.</p>

<p>1. It is said that the term <i>Sabbath</i> signifies <i>rest</i>;
therefore the first day, being commonly observed
as a day of rest, may properly be called the Sabbath.
In reply to this, it may be said, that when,
by custom and common consent, any term is used
to express a particular place or thing, it then becomes
a proper name for that thing, and signifies
only that thing to which it is applied. For instance,
<span class="pagenum">{12-2}</span>
a <i>tabernacle</i> means a place of worship. Yet, in
New York, where this name is used to express a
particular and well-known place of worship, it
would be absurd and false to say you were at the
<i>Tabernacle</i>, and mean the Church of the Messiah.
So with the term Sabbath; although the word
strictly means <i>rest</i>, yet after the Scriptures throughout
the Old and New Testaments have used this
term to express a particular rest, which occurred
on the seventh day, it would be foolish and deceptive
to speak of the Sabbath and mean the first day of
the week. It may be farther said, that if this argument
be good for calling the first day the Sabbath,
and if the fact of its being a <i>rest</i>-day makes it the
Sabbath, then may the Mohammedans properly call
the <i>sixth</i> day the Sabbath, and the fact that they
rest upon that day makes it the Sabbath. Yes,
and those Mexican Indians, whom Cortes found
keeping the <i>fourth</i> day, may properly call that day
the Sabbath, and directly it is made such. Even
those people in Guinea, whom Purchase describes
as having a <i>rest</i>-day, but which, says he, "they observe
not upon our Sunday, nor upon the Jews'
Sabbath day, but hold it upon Tuesday, the <i>second</i>
working day of the week," may properly call that
day the Sabbath, and straightway it becomes such.
Are the observers of the first day ready to rest
upon such ground for calling that day the Sabbath, or
to continue to call it Sabbath when there is no better
ground? We hope not. And we feel bound,
as those who respect the Bible, and dare not charge
the Author of that Book with folly in calling the seventh
day only the Sabbath, to protest against such
abuse of the language of Scripture.</p>

<p>2. The second reason frequently urged, is, that
the first day <i>comes in the room</i> of the seventh day,
<span class="pagenum">{12-3}</span>
and may therefore properly be called the Sabbath.
Aside from the fact that the Scriptures say <i>not a
word</i> about a substitution of the one day for the
other, it may be said in reply, that if the argument
be good, then the Lord's Supper may be called the
<i>Passover</i>, and King Solomon may be called King
<i>David</i>.</p>

<p>3. A third reason alledged for calling the first
day the Sabbath, is, because it has long been the
practice of Christians to call it so. In answering
this assertion, it may be worth while to inquire
what has been the practice of Christians in this
matter. Few will deny, that wherever, in the New
Testament, the word Sabbath refers to a weekly
religious day, it is the seventh day. When the <i>first</i>
day of the week is spoken of, it is under its appropriate
title. For nearly the whole of the first century,
then, we have the testimony of Scripture that
the name <i>Sabbath</i> belonged exclusively to the seventh
day. During the succeeding four hundred
years, there were large numbers, both in the Eastern
church, about Constantinople, and in the Western
church, about Rome, who kept the Sabbath.
And when ecclesiastical councils, in the fourth
and fifth centuries, began to enact laws against
them, they condemned Sabbath-keeping altogether.
From this it is apparent, that the idea of calling the
first day the Sabbath had not then entered their
minds. What day was meant when the term Sabbath
was used for five hundred years later still, the
learned Dr. Peter Heylyn has told us in the following
words:&mdash;"Wherever, for a thousand years and
upwards, we meet with <i>Sabbatum</i>, in any writer, of
what name soever, it must be understood of no day
but <i>Saturday</i>." Indeed, if we search all the books
which have been written on this and kindred subjects
<span class="pagenum">{12-4}</span>
up to the time of the Reformation, we shall
not find that the first day was to any considerable
extent regarded as the Sabbath or called by that
name. Dr. Richard Whately, Archbishop of Dublin,
in a late work on the subject of the Sabbath,
says, "in fact, the notion against which I am contending,
[viz. that the fourth commandment binds
Christians to hallow the first day of the week, and
that it may properly be called the Sabbath,] seems,
as far as I can recollect, to have originated with the
Puritans, not much more than 200 years ago, and
to have been for a considerable time confined to
them, though it was subsequently adopted by some
members of our church."</p>

<p>So far is it from being true, then, that the first
day has been universally called the Sabbath among
Christians, that even now, by the best authorities
upon such subjects, it is not called Sabbath at all.
The Records of England up to the present time
invariably call the <i>seventh</i> day the Sabbath. In the
Journals of the House of Lords, whatever is entered
as having been done on the seventh day, or
Saturday, is under the date, <i>Die Sabbati</i>, upon the
Sabbath day. The same is true of the House of
Commons. The Rules and Records of the King's
Bench, and the Latin Records in the Court of Exchequer
and in Chancery, do likewise call the seventh
day the Sabbath. These things may be known
by any who will take the trouble to examine; and
they show how groundless and erroneous is the
supposition to which we are replying. Indeed, in
many languages the seventh day is called by a
name which indicates its sabbatic character. In
Low Dutch it is called <i>rust-dagh</i>, the day of rest.
In English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, it has its right name,
<i>the Sabbath</i>, the day of rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{12-5}</span>
Now let us look at some of the <i>consequences</i> of
calling the first day by the name of the Sabbath.
It has given occasion for Papists to charge Protestants
with neglecting the Scriptures to follow
their traditions. The Papists claim, that the change
of the Sabbath is the work of their own church,
and that the Scriptures nowhere warrant the keeping
of the first day, much less the calling it by the
name of the Sabbath. Who will deny this latter
position? Again, it has led some earnest and pious
men to charge the teachers of religion with "befooling
and misleading the people." Proof of this
may be found to any extent in books writted on the
subject in the seventeenth century. The charge is
there distinctly and frequently made, of designedly
using deceptive arguments.</p>

<p>We will not undertake to say, that those who
are accustomed to speak in a manner so likely to
deceive, design to do that. But we will say, that
such would be the natural effect of their language.
It would leave upon the minds of many an impression,
that they were not only bound to pay peculiar
respect to the first day of the week, but that the
fourth commandment required of them such respect.
For a religious teacher knowingly to make this impression,
is to be guilty of directly fostering error.
Nay, more; if he should call the first day the
Sabbath, and refer to the fourth commandment as
inculcating the duty of observing that day; or
should, without direct reference to that law, express
himself in such a way as to leave his hearers
to suppose that it required the observance of the
first day, he would be wanting in faithfulness to
the truth, and exposed to the denunciation of those
who add to or take from it.</p>

<p>No doubt many will think, that at a time when
the prevailing tendency is to disregard all sacred
<span class="pagenum">{12-6}</span>
seasons, it were better not to say these things, but to
leave men under an impression that the law of God
requires the observance of the first day of the
week, and sanctions calling that day the Sabbath.
But this prevailing disregard of the day of rest, is
an important reason for urging an examination
of the foundation upon which the Sabbath rests.
Common prudence, to say nothing of Christian sincerity,
would require us, in such circumstances, to
place the duty upon its true ground. If it will not
stand there, it will stand nowhere. It is a dangerous
experiment to encourage or connive at misconceptions
in a point like this. And even if we felt
assured that it would be right, we are fully convinced
that it would be inexpedient. It is exceedingly
dangerous to acknowledge an unsound principle,
although it may promise to conduct us to desirable
results, or, at the worst, to produce no bad
effects. It ought to be remembered, that it was in
apparently trivial and harmless points, that those
false principles were allowed, which have infused
their poison into the Romish and other apostate
churches&mdash;a poison which, commencing with the
extremities, has worked its way rapidly towards
the vitals, and diffused its effects through the whole
system. It is not, then, a matter of small moment.
The most important and disastrous consequences
may result from baptizing a day of human invention
with a name which the Scriptures apply exclusively
to one appointed of God.</p>

<p>THE BIBLE SABBATH.</p>

</div>

<p>Most professors of religion, who found their faith on
the Word of God, attach much importance to a weekly
day of sacred rest, however much they may differ
in regard to the day to be sanctified as the Sabbath,
or the manner in which its sacred hours are to be improved.
It is not the design of the writer of this
small tract, to enter upon the discussion of the multifarious
points of disputation, which have been raised
by most writers, in treating this question, but simply
to exhibit the scriptural account of the day to be honored
unto the Lord, with some cursory remarks on
the prominent topics of the controversy, which can
be, and which ought to be, determined by direct reference
"<i>to the law and the testimony</i>." Without,
therefore, any pretensions to an extended confutation
of men's hypotheses and men's subterfuges on this
subject, he desires merely to present a concise epitome
of <i>what saith the Scriptures</i> in reference to the
day which legitimately challenges our profound veneration
and implicit obedience; and will restrict his
comments; on the bearings of the sacred text, to as
few words as is practicable in a matter of such grave
importance; that, in embracing and defending so sacred
an institution, and in responding to the scriptural
interrogation, "<i>Who hath required this at your
hand?</i>" the reader may, confidently and without fear
of contradiction, answer, "<i>The Lord thy God&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{13-4}</span>
Almighty Jehovah!</i>" and lay his finger on the clear,
unequivocal, ungarbled, "<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>," for
his practice.</p>

<p>The <i>Scriptures</i> tell us, that God "rested on the
<i>seventh day</i> from all his work which he had made;
and God blessed the <i>seventh day</i> and <i>sanctified</i> it."
Gen. 2:2, 3. This is the first notice of the Sabbath
in the Bible; and it is the first religious institution established
by the Almighty for the benefit of all after
generations. The rest of the testimonies of the Lord
to the sacredness of his holy day, are like unto it,
wherever they occur in the <i>Inspired Volume</i>.</p>

<p>During the sojourn of the children of Israel in the
wilderness, the Lord, to supply their necessities, sent
manna daily, save on the <i>seventh day</i>; thus recognizing
strictly his holy Sabbath, by affording them a
<i>double portion</i> on the <i>sixth</i> day, and requiring them
to secure it at that time for the <i>seventh day</i>.</p>

 <p class="small">"And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath
 given you to eat. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.
 Gather of it every man according to his eating; an omer for every man
 according to the number of your persons, take ye every man for them
 which are in your tents. And the children of Israel did so, and
 gathered, some more, some less. And when they did mete it with an
 omer, he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had
 gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his
 eating. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
 Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses, but some of them left
 it until the morning, and it bred worms and stank; and Moses was
 wroth with them. And they gathered it every morning, every man
 according to his eating; when the sun waxed hot it melted. And it
 came to pass, that on the <i>sixth day</i>, they gathered
 <i>twice</i> as much bread, <i>two</i> omers for <i>one</i> man; and
 all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. And he said
 unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To-morrow is the
 rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake
 to-day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over
 lay up for you to be kept until the morning. And they laid it up till
 the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not
 <span class="pagenum">{13-5}</span>
 stink, neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said, Eat that
 to-day; for to-day is the Sabbath unto the Lord; <i>to-day</i> ye
 shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it; but on
 the <i>seventh day</i>, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be
 none. And it came to pass, that there went out some people on the
 <i>seventh day</i> for to gather, and they found none. And the Lord
 said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my
 laws? See, for the Lord hath given you the <i>Sabbath</i>, therefore
 he giveth you on the <i>sixth</i> day the bread of <i>two days</i>;
 abide ye every man in his place on the <i>seventh day</i>." Exod.
 16:15-30.</p>

<p>This was <i>before</i> the giving of the law, and is irrefragible
evidence of respect unto the Sabbath <i>before
the law was promulgated</i>.</p>

<p>When the Decalogue, written on stone by the
finger of God, was committed to the Israelites, the
obligation to honor the Sabbath&mdash;the <i>seventh day</i>&mdash;was
emphatically <i>renewed</i>, and most explicitly defined
and enjoined.</p>

 <p class="small">"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor
 and do all thy work; but the <i>seventh day</i> is the <i>Sabbath</i>
 of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
 son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy
 cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days
 the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
 rested the <i>seventh day</i>; wherefore the Lord blessed the
 <i>Sabbath day</i> and <i>hallowed</i> it." Exod. 20:8-11.</p>

<p>The same is reïterated by the same writer in another
place.</p>

 <p class="small">"Six days shall work be done; but the <i>seventh day</i> is the
 Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein; it
 is the <i>Sabbath of the Lord</i> in all your dwellings." Lev. 23:3.</p>

<p>The reader will observe, that this commandment
does not ordain a <i>new</i> and <i>peculiar</i> institution, but <i>reminds</i>
the Israelites of one which had been established
long prior to their existence as a nation, to be had
in remembrance and to be rigidly observed. "Remember
<span class="pagenum">{13-6}</span>
the Sabbath day to keep it holy." The reader
will also observe, that it does not simply appoint <i>a</i>
Sabbath, or a seventh part of time to be consecrated
as holy time, but that the precise time, the particular
day, is specifically certified by Jehovah himself&mdash;that
it is <i>the day</i>, and not the <i>institution</i>, which
the Lord blessed and hallowed; that it was not the
<i>sabbatic law</i>, but the <i>day of rest</i>, which was enjoined.
The law was predicated on the <i>sanctified day</i>, not
the day accommodated to the institution; and that
there might be no mistake on the subject, the law defines
the day <i>as it found it</i>, and assigns clearly and
most unequivocally the reason for its observance. It
aims simply at hallowing the <i>day</i>, the precise, particular
day; which is still more emphatically expressed in the original,
<span dir="rtl" xml:lang="he" lang="he" title="Yom HaShabat">יום השבת</span>,
"the <i>day</i> of <i>the rest</i>,"
because <i>in it</i>, the day, God rested from all his work,
and subsequently enjoined like rest, on the same day,
and for the same purpose, upon all his people. This
Bible truth ought to be sufficient to overset all the
sophistry of equivocators, in their attempts to blind the
inquirer, by astutely insinuating the idea, that the
<i>sabbatic law</i> only demands the consecration of <i>a seventh
portion of time</i>, which position, they, in turn, as
stoutly repudiate, when any one sees proper to choose
any other seventh part of time than the day which
they propound for them. To proceed; Nehemiah
says:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
 Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves and lading asses; as also wine,
 grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into
 Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them on the day
 wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein,
 which brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold on the Sabbath
 unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with
 the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that
 ye do and profane the Sabbath day? Did not your fathers
 <span class="pagenum">{13-7}</span>
 thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this
 city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.
 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
 dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut,
 and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath;
 and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no
 burden be brought in on the Sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers
 of all kinds of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I
 testified against them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so
 again, I will lay hands on you. From this time forth came they no
 more on the Sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should
 cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates to
 sanctify the Sabbath day." Neh. 13:15-22.</p>

<p>To turn to the New Testament, our blessed Redeemer
proclaimed himself Lord of the Sabbath,
(Mark 2:28,) thereby incorporating it in the new dispensation.
He also declared most distinctly, that he
did not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it; that
not one jot or tittle should pass from the law, till all
be fulfilled. Matt. 5:17, 18. Luke also affirms, in
reference to the course of the disciples after the crucifixion,
that they "rested the Sabbath day <i>according
to the commandment</i>." Luke 23:56. This was <i>after</i>
Christ had declared that all his work was <i>finished</i>&mdash;the
new covenant perfected, and he had been nailed
to the tree. This doubtless refers to the commandment
to observe the <i>seventh day</i>. No one disputes it,
as no command was given to observe any other day.
And from the Acts of the Apostles, we find that they
made <i>it</i> the day of their special ministrations of the
Word, as their Lord and Master had done before
them.</p>

 <p class="small">"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia
 and went into the synagogue on the <i>Sabbath day</i>, and sat down.
 And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the
 synagogue sent unto them saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any
 word of exhortation for the people, say on. Then Paul stood up, and
 beckoning with <span class="pagenum">{13-8}</span>
 his hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience."
 Acts 13:14, 15. "And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue,
 the <i>Gentiles</i> besought that these words might be preached to
 them the next <i>Sabbath</i>. * * * And the next <i>Sabbath day</i>
 came almost the whole city to hear the word of God." Id. verses 42,
 44. Paul "reasoned in the synagogue <i>every</i> Sabbath, and
 persuaded the Jews and the Greeks." Id. 18:4, 5.</p>

<p>All the <i>promises</i>, and all the <i>penalties</i> connected
with the observance or the desecration of the Sabbath,
refer to the <i>seventh day Sabbath</i>, and to no other <i>in
future</i>.</p>

 <p class="small">"Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth
 hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth
 his hand from doing any evil." Isa. 56:2.</p>

 <p class="small">"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure
 on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord,
 honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
 thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; then thou shall
 delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the
 high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
 thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Id. 58:13, 14.</p>

 <p class="small">"Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on
 the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; neither
 carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, neither
 do ye any work, but hallow ye the Sabbath day, as I commanded your
 fathers. * * * And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken
 unto me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of
 the city on the Sabbath day, but hallow the Sabbath day to do no work
 therein, then shall there enter into the gates of the city, kings and
 princes, sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on
 horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants
 of Jerusalem; and this shall remain forever. * * * But if ye will not
 hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden,
 even entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I
 will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the
 palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched." Jer. 17:21, 22,
 24, 25, 27.</p>

<p>No where in the Inspired Word have we any other
<span class="pagenum">{13-9}</span>
weekly Sabbath appointed. No where has that Sabbath
ever been <i>abrogated</i> or <i>superseded</i>. No where
in the Scriptures is any other day called the Sabbath-day.
No where is any other day <i>required</i> to be observed
<i>as the Sabbath</i>. If, then, <span class="smcap">He</span>, the Almighty,
gave the <i>seventh day</i>, and sanctified and hallowed it
<i>as his Sabbath</i>, and has not abrogated it&mdash;has not absolved
us from its duties, nor delegated authority to
others to do so&mdash;it remains in as full force as when first
instituted by Jehovah himself, and will stand in the
Judgment against all the crafty inventions and futile
subterfuges of perverse, rebellious man.</p>

<p>The foregoing summary is a plain, unvarnished, unmutilated
<i>scriptural account</i> of God's rest-day, which
<span class="smcap">He</span> enjoined on all mankind, for all ages, for all nations,
tongues, and kindred. Some persons, nay, the
great mass of the Christian world, have been taught,
that the Sabbath alluded to is a "<i>Jewish Sabbath</i>,"
and "<i>has been done away</i>;" in proof of which position,
they adduce the passages in Paul's Epistle to the
Colossians&mdash;"Let no man, therefore, judge you in
meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of
the new moon, or of the Sabbath-<i>days</i>, which are a
shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
Col. 2:16, 17. "Who blotted out the hand-writing
of ordinances, that was against us, which was contrary
to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
his cross." Col. 2:14. This, I must remark, proves
<span class="pagenum">{13-10}</span>
<i>too much</i>; for if it has abrogated the seventh-day
Sabbath, it has blotted out the sabbatic law also; unless
it be shown, that <i>it</i> is reserved, or that another
has been re-enacted, clearly and expressly ordained.
If so, let its advocates point to a single requirement,
an unequivocal injunction, to observe any other day
as the Sabbath, and it will terminate all controversy
on the subject. The "hand-writing of ordinances,"
which was "nailed to the cross," was merely "the ceremonial
law," the onerous burdens of the Levitical
ritual, not the "moral law of commandments"&mdash;the
Decalogue! If the opposite view be correct, then
the Sabbath, or any "rest-day," is "against us," contrary
to our nature and wants, and is not for our good,
and ought to be annulled and obliterated forever.
Then, also, we are driven to the doctrine of the
"Friends," that all days are alike holy under the gospel
dispensation. The advocates for the first day of
the week can not consistently escape this dilemma.
They must accept the Sabbath hallowed by the Lord,
or hallow all days alike.</p>

<p>Much as man has attempted to obscure and pervert
this holy institution, the Word of Truth is clear, express
and emphatic, in regard to the perpetuity of the
particular day to be hallowed, as well as it is explicit
in the precise time to be sanctified. The Scriptures
no where speak of a "<i>Jewish Sabbath</i>" or a "<i>Christian
Sabbath</i>." The Sabbath of the Bible is but one,
and has but one name&mdash;"<i>the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God</i>;" which the Scriptures declare is the <i>seventh day</i>,
instituted more than two thousand years before there
was a Jew in the world, and, consequently, could not
have been a "Jewish Sabbath." The Sabbath, Christ,
who is "Lord of the Sabbath," asserts, "was made
for man"&mdash;the whole race of man&mdash;not for a particular
nation or people, but for <i>mankind at large</i>.</p>

<p>It is proper here to remark, that this sneering at
<span class="pagenum">{13-11}</span>
the "<i>Jewish Sabbath</i>," which in times past was, and
still is, by weak minds, constantly resorted to, in the
absence of legitimate argument, to prejudice the populace
against giving this subject a fair and impartial
examination, and thereby to lead them to prejudge
the case, has, within a few years past, been abandoned
by all sensible and consistent advocates for the
<i>sabbatic institution</i>. They find that it stultifies their
own pretensions, and has done much damage to themselves
in sustaining the claims of sacredness for any
other day; for, while they maintain that the ancient
Sabbath was a Jewish institution, they unwittingly
prove that there is no longer any Sabbath to be observed,
since they fail to show that another has been
ordained or established for the Christian Church. If
a "Jewish Sabbath," it was done away with by the
Jewish dispensation; and if no other Sabbath has
been expressly appointed by Divine authority, the
Christian Church is certainly left without the Sabbath,
or any substitute possessing any of its sacredness&mdash;a
sacredness which can only be derived from an <i>express</i>
and <i>explicit</i> mandate from the Lord of the Sabbath.
That puerile quibble, the <i>nick-name</i> "Jewish Sabbath,"
has, therefore, been abandoned by the most
prominent writers of the present day; who generally
fall back and found the <i>institution</i> (the origin
and grounds for its perpetuity) long anterior to the
"Jewish," the Mosaic dispensation&mdash;even back to the
Sabbath of Paradise. Thus Dr. Barnes, of Philadelphia,
in a series of sermons on this subject, delivered
and published in the fall of 1845, advocates this
position, and contends strenuously for the <i>Ante-Mosaic
Sabbath</i>. The same view was inculcated by the
"National Lord's Day Convention," held at Baltimore,
November, 1844; and it has been reiterated
more distinctly and emphatically by "The Rhode
Island Sabbath Union," in an address to the people of
<span class="pagenum">{13-12}</span>
that State, in 1846, to which, among others, we find attached
the name of Dr. Wayland, the honored President
of Brown University. The Committee of the
Rhode Island "<i>Sabbath</i> Union," in calling attention
to the <i>claims of the Sabbath</i>, remark:</p>

 <p class="small">"The Lord of the Sabbath has here said, '<i>The Sabbath was made for
 man</i>.' Man is here used, most certainly, as a <i>generic</i> term,
 and, therefore, presents a universal proposition. The Sabbath was not
 made for <i>man</i>, for man as a genus, as a race, unless it was
 made for every individual of the race; for the first, and for the
 last man; for the first generation, and for every other. The Sabbath,
 then, must have existed from the beginning, and is as old as the
 human race. Our Lord says, moreover, '<i>The</i> Sabbath was made for
 man.' He says not, the Jewish Sabbath, or the Christian Sabbath, but
 <i>the</i> Sabbath, the common, the universal one, which belongs to
 mankind. Is this not the very language to denote a universal and
 perpetual institution?</p>

 <p class="small">"Let us look at the connection of the Sabbath with the work of
 creation. 'God blessed the <i>seventh</i> day and sanctified it.' If
 the Creator had merely <i>rested</i> on the seventh day, it would
 have been an impressive consecration. But when he proceeds to bless
 and sanctify it, there is authority, a positive Sabbath, forming a
 part of the primeval arrangement, when God fixed the order in which
 the world should go&mdash;six days labor and one day rest, over and over
 forever. The first week of the world, then, was not completed till
 there had been a Sabbath, as well as a first day or a sixth. Is not
 this indicative of the universality and perpetuity of the
 institution?"</p>

<p>Here we might rest the question, with perfect safety,
if the mass of mankind would be content with the plain
teachings of the Bible; but, having "itching ears,"
they, unfortunately, are too apt to leave "the law and
the testimony," and cleave to "the commandments of
men;" which teach them, that "<i>Christ</i> <span class="smcap">or</span> <i>his Apostles</i>"
have transferred the sacredness of the seventh
day to the first day of the week. The writer, therefore,
feels constrained to bring before his readers the
passages on which that notion is predicated, to exhibit
the weakness of their untenable position, and thereby
establish the Sabbath of the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{13-13}</span>
What saith the Scriptures to support the claims of
the first day of the week to be <i>holy time</i>? The first
notice we have of the disciples being together on
"the first day of the week," on which the assumed
"change" is predicated, is found in the Gospel by
John:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when
 the doors were shut <i>for fear of the Jews</i> (mark that!) came
 Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
 And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side.
 Then were the disciples <i>glad</i> when they saw the Lord." John
 20:19, 20.</p>

<p>This passage contains no command, no intimation
whatever, to sanctify that day. It does not even
claim that they were there for any sacred purpose,
much less to celebrate the Sabbath, or institute a new
day of worship, but simply for common protection,
"for fear of the Jews;" and a design to comfort them
in their trepidation is all the legitimate inference we
can draw from the circumstance of Christ's appearing
unto them. All the Apostles were not together;
<i>Thomas was absent</i>! If they had met together to
<i>sabbatize</i>, he, certainly, would have been with them.
Not having been present, and not having seen the
risen Saviour, while doubting and disputing on the
subject of his resurrection, "<i>eight days afterward</i>,"
Christ appeared again, to confound the incredulity of
Thomas, and for no other ostensible purpose.</p>

 <p class="small">"Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when
 Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen
 the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the
 print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
 believe. And after <i>eight</i> days the disciples <i>were
 within</i>,<span
 class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
 and Thomas with them: then came <span class="pagenum">{13-14}</span>
 Jesus, <i>the door being shut</i>, and stood in the midst, and said,
 Peace be unto you. Then said he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger,
 and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my
 side, and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and
 said unto him, My Lord and my God." John 20:24-28.</p>

<p>So much, <i>and that is all</i>, is the authority adduced
by the advocates for the sacredness of the first day for
Christ having changed the day of rest, the Sabbath,
or having given his sanction to the change. Ought
such a vague <i>inference</i> overturn the fiat of the
Almighty&mdash;change times and laws ordained by Jehovah
to endure forever? Is the "being together," save
one, of the twelve, "for fear of the Jews," and "being
within eight days afterward," any evidence of their
being there to celebrate the "Sabbath" or Lord's
day? Is there, in these transactions, any re-enactment
of the sabbatic law, which some persons maintain
was abrogated by the "blotting out of the hand-writing
of ordinances?" Is there any injunction
issued by them&mdash;the apostles&mdash;requiring the disciples
to honor, hallow, and sanctify the first day of the
week, in any of the above proceedings?</p>

<p>The next Scripture assumed for the substitution of
the first day of the week in the place of the Sabbath
of the Lord, is found in the Acts of the Apostles:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">"And upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came
 together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on
 the morrow, and continued his speech until midnight. And there were
 many lights in the upper chamber where they were assembled together.
 And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, being
 fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
 down with sleep, and fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him, said, Trouble
 not yourselves, for his life is in him. When he, therefore, was come
 up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while,
 even till break of day, he departed." Acts 20:7-11.</p>

<p>It is necessary to a proper understanding here, to
<span class="pagenum">{13-15}</span>
bear in mind&mdash;1st. That it was the custom of the disciples,
in the days of the apostles, to meet together,
and break bread, <i>every</i> day. "They continued steadfast
in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in
breaking of bread, and in prayers." "And they, continuing
<i>daily</i> with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their
meat with gladness and singleness of heart." 2d. That
in those times a day was counted "the evening and
the morning were the first day." "From even unto
even shall ye celebrate your Sabbaths." Lev. 23:32.
Thus it appears, by this passage, that they had simply
met, as was their uniform, daily custom, to celebrate
the breaking of bread on the evening (the commencement
of the day), it being the last evening Paul
was to be with them; and in all probability the
circumstance would not have been noticed so particularly,
but to introduce the case of Eutychus, in confirmation
of Paul's miraculous powers. The passage
does not prove any thing for the sacredness of the
first day of the week, but proves much against it; for,
if the first day of the week is holy time, Paul, in
preaching till midnight, and departing on the morrow,
would be a Sabbath-breaker for traveling on that day.
He would have kept the evening only. "From <i>even</i>
unto <i>even</i> shall ye celebrate your Sabbaths." The
same disregard for the sacredness of the first day of
the week was manifested by the Redeemer himself,
in traveling on the "resurrection day" to Emmaus, a
distance of seven and a half miles, while a "Sabbath-day's
journey" was restricted to <i>one mile</i>: slender
evidence, indeed, of the Saviour's having transferred
the holiness of the <i>Sabbath</i> to "the first day of the
week," or having "sanctioned" it, as is often claimed
by its advocates.</p>

<p>The next passage adduced is found in Paul's First
Epistle to the Corinthians&mdash;"Upon the first <i>day</i> of
<span class="pagenum">{13-16}</span>
the week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as
God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings
when I come." 1&nbsp;Cor. 16:2. First <i>day</i>? Day is
not in the original, but is supplied, and is so designated
by being italicized. So the true reading is,
"In the first of the week." However, if it mean the
first day, Sunday, it makes it a commercial day, a
day of business, a day of reckoning, not of <i>rest</i>, as
it requires a man to cast up his accounts, to find what
amount he can "lay by."</p>

<p>The last text, and the one most relied upon, is from
John's Revelation&mdash;"I was in the spirit on the Lord's
day." Rev. 1:10. There is nothing in this passage,
or in the context, to indicate that it was the first day
of the week. It is a mere <i>assumption</i>, without any
Scripture to fortify the position. The best biblical
critics admit that there is no scriptural evidence to
identify the expression with the first day of the week.
If we follow the Protestant rule, to prove Scripture
by Scripture, and not evade the plain teachings of the
Bible, it will be an easy matter to see a much more
apt application of the expression. Many of the best
commentators suppose that it alludes to the Gospel-day.
"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see <i>my day</i>;
he saw it, and was glad." John 8:56. Was not
this a day which approximates (if it will not be admitted
to be identical) not only in <i>idea</i>, but in a <i>kin-name</i>&mdash;the
<i>day of Christ</i>&mdash;the Gospel-day? Paul
speaks of it as something yet to come. "That ye
may approve things that are excellent; that ye may
be sincere and without offense, till the <i>day of Christ</i>."
"Holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in
the <i>day of Christ</i>, that I have not run in vain, neither
labored in vain." "Who shall also confirm you unto
the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ." "Now, we beseech you, brethren,
by the <i>coming</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by
<span class="pagenum">{13-17}</span>
our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon
shaken in mind, or troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of
Christ is at hand." "That the spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord Jesus." Phil. 1:10; 2:16;
1&nbsp;Cor. 1:8; 2&nbsp;Thess. 2:1, 2, 3; 1&nbsp;Cor. 5:5. Again,
it is maintained by some expounders, that allusion is
had to the Judgment Day. "The day of the Lord
will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and all
the works therein, shall be burned up." 2&nbsp;Peter 3:10.
Therefore John, in saying, "I was in the spirit
on the Lord's day," simply asserts, that in prophetic
vision his spirit reached forward to the great day for
which all other days were made, and beheld the momentous
transactions of that awful crisis, which he
was directed to reveal to the churches on earth.</p>

<p>From this brief examination, it appears, that the
term "Lord's day," as here used, does not refer to any
particular day of the week. But if it refer to any special
day of the week, as some suppose, it must refer
to the seventh; for that is the sanctified, hallowed
<i>rest-day</i> of the Bible, and is the only day which the
Lord calls his holy day (Is. 58:13), and therefore
must be the Lord's day. If, however, the term
"Lord's day," used by John, does not refer to the
gospel day, or the day of judgment, nor to the Lord's
"holy day," the seventh-day Sabbath, but alludes to
a festival day to commemorate the resurrection, as is
assumed, where is the command requiring it to be
kept holy? And where is the evidence in the Scriptures,
that it was kept <i>as the Sabbath</i>, or in <i>place of
the Sabbath</i>?</p>

<p>Even were there any intimations given by the
prophets or the apostles, (which we deny,) that the resurrection
day should be regarded as the "ceremony-worship-day"
<span class="pagenum">{13-18}</span>
under the gospel dispensation, where is
the evidence in the Scriptures that the first day of the
week is or was the resurrection day? It is assumed,
not proved. The Bible and human theories are at
conflict on this subject. It is generally assumed, that
the Redeemer was crucified on Friday, and rose early
on Sunday morning. This makes Christ a liar; for
he said, "As Jonas was <i>three days</i> and <i>three nights</i>
in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man be <i>three
days</i> and <i>three nights</i> in the heart of the earth."
Matth. 12:40. Crucified on Friday, and rising on
Sunday morning, would make but part of three days,
and only two nights. Christ said three days <i>and</i> three
nights, and he certainly must be right. Therefore,
crucified on Friday, he could not have risen on Sunday.
The New Testament does not assert that he
rose on the first day of the week; it only says, that
he was <i>seen</i> on the first of the week, not first <i>day</i>.
In all the places in which allusion is had to this matter,
(Matth. 28:1; Mark 16:1, 9; Luke 24:1; John
20:1, 19), the original says, in the first of the week&mdash;<i>day</i>
is not once named, but is supplied in our version,
as is indicated by being italicised. But even if
the term first of the week implies first day, the Scriptures
no where assert that he <i>rose</i> on that day. Being
<i>seen</i>, and <i>rising</i>, are two entirely different matters.
So is a <i>part</i> of three days and two nights different
from three days and three nights. If Jesus had said,
"<i>three days and nights</i>," it might not involve the
present difficulty; but no one questions that Jonas
was three whole days and three whole nights in the
whale's belly. Then, as the Redeemer makes that
the simile of his own confinement in the heart of
the earth, the antitype, to be verified and accredited,
must be like unto the type. He must have
been there the <i>three days</i> and the <i>three nights</i>, according
to his word. It is vain presumption, arrant
<span class="pagenum">{13-19}</span>
blasphemy, to make it any less to gratify a human
theory. Let God be true, though it make all men
liars.</p>

<p>In the absence of all direct <i>scriptural evidence</i> to
sustain the assumption, that the first day of the week is
the "<i>resurrection day</i>;" and in the absence of all such
evidence, that the Lord designed to elevate the
first day of the week to the special regard of the
Christian Church, and confer upon it the sacredness
of the ancient Sabbath; would we not, at least, have
some intimation of it in the writings of the prophets,
in which all the important circumstances of the Redeemer's
life and mission are foreshadowed? Where,
reader, will you find any thing in them that predicts
any <i>change</i> of the <i>holy Sabbath</i> to the <i>resurrection
day</i>? If found, let it be adduced. The Sabbath is a
standing monument against <i>Atheism</i>, for all ages, declaring
the workmanship of God; yet some <i>assume</i>,
that as <i>redemption</i> is a greater work, and a more important
work, than the <i>creation</i> of the universe and
the living <i>souls</i> which inhabit all the spheres, therefore
the <i>resurrection day</i> ought to be honored as the
<i>rest-day</i>. Has not the <i>Lord</i> the right to determine
this matter? If <span class="smcap">He</span> deemed it important that the
<i>resurrection day</i> be thus distinguished, would <span class="smcap">He</span> not
have <i>declared it</i>, expressly, unto us? Would <span class="smcap">He</span>
have left us to <i>infer</i> it? Can we, will we, be justified
in casting aside the <i>explicit</i> command of the Most
High, in this matter, to substitute our <i>fancied</i> day of
greater <i>importance</i> than the one the <i>Almighty</i> has
<i>ordained</i>? "Wherefore kick ye at <i>my</i> sacrifice and
at <i>mine</i> offering, which I have commanded?" 1&nbsp;Sam.
2:29. "It is hard for thee to kick against the
pricks." Acts 9:5.</p>

<p>If, then, there is no evidence in the Scriptures, that the
<i>first day of the week</i> is the "<i>resurrection day</i>," (which,
even if satisfactorily established, would not invalidate
<span class="pagenum">{13-20}</span>
our position, nor entitle it to supersede the holy Sabbath);
and, more particularly, if there is no evidence
in the Inspired Volume, that the term "Lord's day" is
intended to designate the <i>first day of the week</i>; we are
reduced, by every principle of reasoning, to regard
the <i>seventh day</i>&mdash;the Heaven-heralded Sabbath&mdash;as the
only "Lord's day," the only "rest-day," sanctified and
hallowed by the Almighty as holy time.</p>

<p>All days, in one sense, are Lord's days; but there
has never been but one <i>Heaven-appointed</i> weekly <i>Sabbath</i>,
and that, most unequivocally, is the <i>seventh day</i>.
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy"&mdash;"the
<i>seventh day</i> is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex.
20:8. If that sacred injunction has been abrogated, we
should expect&mdash;(for it would be unreasonable to recognize
its repeal or transfer, without as explicit and as
authoritative a mandate from the Court of Heaven)&mdash;at
least a <i>re-enactment</i> somewhat thus: "<i>From the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus, ye shall no longer</i> <span class="smcap">sabbatize</span>,
<i>but shall give heed to the assembling of yourselves</i>
<span class="smcap">on the first day of the week</span>; <i>in it ye shall do
no work; and, to avoid the appearance of symbolizing
with my ancient people, the Jews</i>, call it no longer the
<i>Sabbath</i>, but designate it by the term <i>Lord's day</i>!"
Is there any intimation of such an <i>abrogation</i>, or such
a <i>transfer</i> of the <i>sacredness of the Sabbath</i> to <i>Sunday</i>,
in the <i>inspired volume</i>? Not the semblance of it.
Even if the early disciples, without any intimation
from the <i>Lord of the Sabbath</i>, but <i>of their own accord</i>,
chose to set apart a special day as a <i>festival day</i>, as
they were wont to do for <i>martyrs</i> and <i>saints</i>, it can
not, certainly, <i>supersede</i> the <i>institution of Jehovah</i>;
neither can they confer upon it the sacredness belonging,
by the <i>decree of the Most High</i>, to <i>his rest-day</i>.
Indeed, this is so evident, that the erudite and frank
<span class="smcap">Neander</span> expressly says, "<i>Opposition to Judaism introduced
the particular festival of Sunday</i>, very early,
<span class="pagenum">{13-21}</span>
indeed, into the place of the <i>Sabbath</i> ... Sunday was
distinguished as a <i>day of joy</i>, by the circumstance that
men did not fast upon it, and that they prayed standing
up, and not kneeling, as Christ had raised up fallen
man to heaven again through his resurrection. The
<i>festival of Sunday</i>, like all other festivals, <i>was always
only a</i> <span class="smcap">human ordinance</span>; and it was far from the intention
of the apostles to establish a <i>divine</i> command
in this respect&mdash;far from them, and from the early
apostolic church, to <i>transfer the laws of the Sabbath
to Sunday</i>. Perhaps at the end of the second century,
<i>a false application of this kind</i> had <i>begun</i> to
take place; for men appear by that time to have considered
laboring on Sunday as a sin."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, then, is the scriptural account of the Sabbath,
and such the frank admission of one of the most distinguished
ecclesiastical historians, who could have no
motive in perverting or misrepresenting the facts in
the case, but who has always shown himself above
all mean subterfuges for any purpose whatever. His
testimony might be fortified by many names of high
authority among writers of eminence, who do not contend
for sabbatizing on the seventh day, yet whose
candor and honesty constrain them to make the like
admission.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen, that the observers of the seventh-day
Sabbath can look up with full confidence of
having a "thus saith the Lord" for their practice;
while the observers of the first day of the week must
confess, with confusion of face, that they are but following
"the commandments of men," and can only
plead "the nakedness of the Fathers," as Whitby
terms their inconsistencies. Will the Lord admit
<span class="pagenum">{13-22}</span>
such a "vain oblation?" Will he suffer such a perversion
of his holy institution to go unreproved?
Where, reader, can you find in the Bible any authority
for appropriating the title of the holy rest-day, the
Sabbath, to the first day of the week? If you can
not, is it not "robbing God" thus to falsify his Word?
Is it not base felony every time any worm of the dust
thus perversely uses the term which <span class="smcap">He</span>, the Sovereign
of the Universe, has attached to his holy day&mdash;thereby
wantonly "changing times and laws"&mdash;overturning
the decrees of the Lord God? Is it not wresting the
Word to your own destruction? If the Lord charge
man with robbery in withholding perishable tithes and
offerings, and curse him for that delinquency, how
much greater, think ye, must be the condemnation of
those who set at naught his prerogative to institute
and ordain the service of the sanctuary? He alone
has the right to impose religious ordinances; and it is
but the reasonable service of his creatures to obey,
implicitly, his righteous mandates&mdash;the sacred injunction,
to hallow and sanctify his holy Sabbath. "Will
a man rob God?" asks the Almighty, through his
prophet; "yet ye have robbed me, saith the Holy
One. Ye are cursed with a curse; for ye have robbed
me, even this whole nation." Mal. 2:8, 9.
Where, then, will you find your excuse for this perversion
of the Word of God, when that Word shall
come to judge you? for it is the Word, the written
Word, (given to be a lamp unto your feet and a light
to your path,) which shall judge you at the last day.
Of old it was said, "From the days of your fathers
ye are gone astray from mine ordinances, and have
not kept them." Mal. 3:7. The apostle of the
Gentiles speaks of those in his day who corrupted the
Word. 2&nbsp;Cor. 2:17. In another place it is asked,
When wilt thou cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord? Acts 13:10. To which interrogation all
<span class="pagenum">{13-23}</span>
are obnoxious who seek out inventions of their own,
or follow "the commandments of men," which subvert
the testimony of the Lord.</p>

<p>Canst thou, reader, contend with the Almighty? It
is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God, when he shall lay judgment to the line, and
righteousness to the plummet, and shall <i>sweep away
the refuge of lies</i>. Isaiah 28:17. The <i>true principle</i>,
reader, and the only <i>safe principle</i>, is, to "<i>let
God be true</i>, though it <i>make every man a liar</i>." Rom.
3:4. "Ye are my friends," says Christ, "if ye do
whatsover I command you." John 14:15. "He
that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
is a liar, and the truth is not in him." 1&nbsp;John
2:4. "In vain do they worship me, teaching for
doctrine the commandments of men." Matt. 15:9.
"What thing soever I command you, observe to do
it; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it."
Deut. 13:32. "Turn not from it to the right hand
or to the left." Josh. 1:7. "Add not unto his
words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar."
Prov. 30:6. "If any man shall add unto these
things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are
written in this book; and if any man shall take away
from the words of this prophecy, God shall take away
his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy
city, and from the things that are written in this book."
Rev. 22:18, 19. Ponder well this subject, reader,
and render unto God the things that are God's, that
it may be well with thee, and thou be admitted into
the rest reserved for those who "delayed not to keep
the commandments"&mdash;for those who keep his covenant
and walk in the way of the Lord.</p>

The Sabbath was no type of Christ&mdash;a <i>shadow</i>, of which

consequently, the term <i>Sabbath-days</i>, here, has
no relevancy if applied to the <i>weekly</i> Sabbath; but it evidently

called <i>Sabbaths</i>, as all the Israelites had at those periods to

<h2>DELAYING OBEDIENCE.</h2>

</div>

<p>To have the understanding enlightened in regard
to duty, and the conscience so thoroughly awake
as to make one feel uneasy in the neglect of it,
and yet to be surrounded with advisers, wearing the
name and title of Christians, who are continually urging
farther delay, is about as uncomfortable a position
as a person of fervent piety needs to be placed
in. To rebuke such advisers in the faithfulness of the
gospel, and yet, at the same time, to behave towards
them with becoming meekness, is not the easiest thing
in the world. Nevertheless, the idea that we may
postpone our obedience to God for a little season, notwithstanding
our convictions, is not to be tolerated.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that a person becomes convinced,
that it is his duty to observe the Sabbath of
the Bible&mdash;the seventh day of the week. Forthwith
he is assailed by his associates with the suggestion,
that he ought not to be in a hurry&mdash;that he ought to
take plenty of time for consideration, at least a year.
Plausible as such advice is, we offset it with a simple
passage of Scripture. "I thought on my ways, and
turned my feet unto thy testimonies; I made haste,
and delayed not to keep thy commandments." Ps.
119:59, 60. Here the Psalmist testifies, that he
turned his feet to obedience, so soon as, by thinking
on his ways, he found that he was walking astray.
He made no delay about it; he did not go about to
consult the wise men of the nation; he did not examine
the writings of the rabbis and doctors, to see
<span class="pagenum">{14-2}</span>
if there was not some way of getting round the duty,
he <i>made haste</i> to render obedience. But, now-a-days,
as soon as a person's conscience begins to lash him
for neglected duty, he is advised to be very careful
about running too hastily. Well, we would not wish
one to be <i>too</i> hasty; but, on the other hand, it may be
well to consider whether there is not such a thing as
being <i>too tardy</i>. Conviction of duty is not to be trifled
with. When any one does violence to his conviction,
he feels that he disobeys God; and such disobedience
is sure to be followed by disastrous results. The
voice of conscience grows more feeble, and (if the disobedience
be persisted in) becomes, at length, hushed
in silence. It may continue to reprove with regard
to other duties, but with regard to that particular one
which has been made the object of willful neglect, it
reproves no more. As a necessary consequence, the
soul suffers the loss of all those blessings which obedience
in that one thing would bring.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Conscience, having yielded to corruption
in one instance, becomes ready to yield in
another. Its sternness has been overcome, and it no
longer guards the soul with that security which it had
been wont to do. It is to the soul what the sense of
modesty is to the female; and, as the female cannot
allow her sense of delicacy to be trifled with without
incurring the risk of a total loss of virtue, so the conscience
cannot, in a single instance, be abused, without
incurring the danger of becoming "seared with a hot
iron." We will not undertake to say, that this is, in
every case, the result; but we <i>do</i> say, that there is
great danger of it. We insist, therefore, that when
one understands what is duty, he ought to lose no
time in putting it in practice. Let him remember,
too, that the wrath of God is revealed against those
"who hold the truth in unrighteousness." Rom. 1:18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{14-3}</span>
But the possibility that one may be mistaken as to
his duty, is often urged as a reason for delay. There
may be something in this; at least, it seems plausible.
Generally, however, this objection is more specious
than solid. At all events, it is so with regard to those
things which are the subject of direct and unequivocal
command. With regard to the Sabbath, we have no
hesitation in saying, that it savors of "the wisdom that
is earthly." The object of those who urge it is to induce
a deference to the views of those who have acquired
great skill in explaining away the divine law.
But we hold, that however doubtful may be the
teachings of Scripture with regard to such questions
as are purely doctrinal, or however obscure the language
in which its prophecies foretell coming events,
with regard to the common, practical duties of life,
the Word of God is so plain that there is no need for
a child to be mistaken. Were it otherwise, it would
be unsuited to the wants of mankind. For, inasmuch
as every one must give account for himself, and not
another for him, it is necessary that each one should
be able to decide his duty for himself. People of
small intellectual capacity must be able to make this
decision, as well as those of more expanded powers;
and children, as well as those of mature age. Hence
duty must be revealed in very simple language. And
how simple the language in which our duty to keep
holy the Sabbath day is revealed! "<i>Remember the
Sabbath-day to keep it holy&mdash;the seventh day is the
Sabbath.</i>" Who can fail to understand it? What
untutored peasant cannot comprehend it? What child
does not perceive its meaning? The command to
refrain from the adoration of images is not more
plain. Yet, when a person of ordinary mental powers
is convinced by it, and begins to think about rendering
obedience, straightway he is admonished that he
<span class="pagenum">{14-4}</span>
does not understand it, and that he would do well to
consult some learned men, some spiritual rabbis or
doctors of divinity, before taking any decided steps!</p>

<p>And what do the learned doctors say, upon being
consulted? Why, that it is the duty of men keep
holy the first day of the week. But how do they
make it appear? Do they produce any precept from
the Scripture, plain and unequivocal, like the fourth
commandment? Not by any means. They can present
nothing which is level to the comprehension of a
child. Whatever they say on the subject, is entirely
above the understanding of children, and entirely
above the understanding of ignorant people. They
talk about the magnitude of redemption, as compared
with the work of creation; they have something to
say about redemption being finished on the first day
of the week, by the resurrection of Christ from the
dead; they lay a few such theological propositions
together, and finally draw out the inference, that the
first day of the week is a holy day. But the plain,
ordinary mind, does not understand this. The child
fails to comprehend it. It is true, he hardly dares to
indulge the thought that learned men may be mistaken;
nevertheless, he is puzzled, extremely puzzled,
to understand it. Is not this conclusive proof,
that no such duty is enjoined in the Book of God?</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, subscribe to the idea, that a
person must, in reference to the Sabbath, or in reference
to any other plain command of Heaven, wait to
consult friends, and learned teachers, and the writings
of fallible men, before rendering obedience. If God
has spoken, "see that ye refuse not him that speaketh."
We do not believe that any one can begin to obey God
too soon.</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent bold">The Seventh-day Baptist General Conference, to the Members of the
Baptist Denomination throughout the United States, holding to the
Observance of the First Day of the Week as a Divine Institution:</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Beloved Brethren:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When our Divine Redeemer dwelt on earth, he
prayed that all his disciples might be "made perfect
in one." As this prayer was in harmony with the
sure word of prophecy, which instructs us to look for
a time when "the watchmen shall see eye to eye, and
sing with united voice," we are sure that it will ultimately
be answered. We see nothing, however, to
warrant us in looking for such a happy consummation,
while we contemplate the multiplied divisions of the
Christian world, perpetuated as they are by the selfishness
of human nature. Here the prospect is dark
indeed. But we have an unshaken confidence in the
power of God to bring about his own purposes, notwithstanding
all the devices of men. "The hearts of
all are in his hands, and he turneth them whithersoever
he will." He that made "the multitude of one
heart and of one soul," in the first age of the church,
can again concentrate his scattered bands, break down
every wall of separation, and enlighten every mind by
the effusion of his Spirit. Then shall Zion move forth,
"clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{15-4}</span>
We rejoice, brethren, that you, as well as ourselves,
are looking for this day of glory. Moreover, we have
knowledge of your firm persuasion, that this glorious
union of the now scattered forces of Israel, can be
effected only upon the basis of divine truth. With a
single glance you see the fallacy of that reasoning,
which calls upon you, for the sake of union, to sacrifice
the least particle of God's Word. Taught by the Spirit
of God, you have learned that the smallest atom of truth
is more precious than fine gold. That meager piety
which finds "non-essentials" in the appointments of
Jehovah, you cannot abide. Your language is, "We
esteem <span class="smcap">all</span> thy precepts concerning <span class="smcap">all</span> things to be
right, and we hate <span class="smcap">every</span> false way."</p>

<p>We know, moreover, that it is the desire of your
hearts, that all dissensions between Christians should
be for ever ended. For this object you are laboring
and praying; and while you are doing so, you have
the enlightened conviction, that your labors and prayers
will be successful, in proportion to the amount of truth
with which your own minds are imbued, and which
you can bring to bear upon the minds of others. Laboring
as you do to expound to others the way of the
Lord more perfectly, we cannot suppose that you are
yourselves unwilling to learn. We therefore approach
you with confidence, affectionately and earnestly requesting
you to take into consideration the subject
which is the only ground of difference between you
and us. In our estimation, it is a subject of great importance;
and though some of you have made it a
matter of thought, we are persuaded that the great
body of your denomination have dismissed it without
any particular investigation. Indeed, we speak not
unadvisedly when we say, that on this question the
whole church of God have been hushed to sleep. In
urging it upon your attention, we think you will not
<span class="pagenum">{15-5}</span>
charge us with wishing to raise disturbance in Zion.
We indulge the hope that you will impute to us the
same disinterestedness of motive by which you yourselves
are actuated when you boldly proclaim your
denominational sentiments upon every high place, and
scatter your publications in every direction. Your
course springs not from any wish to foment disturbance,
but from the pain which your hearts feel to see
the institutions of Christ made void by the traditions
of men. Our action in this matter springs from the
same principle. We feel in regard to the Sabbath
just as you do in regard to baptism. We declare before
God and the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are
moved by a desire for your good and God's glory.</p>

<p>When we look over your large and influential denomination,
we find that, in reference to the subject
upon which we now address you, you are divided into
about three classes. I. Those who, acknowledging
the perpetuity of the Sabbath law, enforce the observance
of the Sabbath by the fourth commandment, but
change the day of its celebration from the seventh to
the first day of the week. II. Those who see the impossibility
of proving a change of the day, and therefore
regard the commandment as abolished by the
death of Christ. But, at the same time, they consider
the first day of the week as an institution entirely new,
to be regulated as to its observance wholly by the New
Testament. III. Those who consider neither the Old
nor the New Testament to impose any obligation upon
them to observe a day of rest, and advocate one merely
on the ground of expediency.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I. To those of you who acknowledge the obligation
of a Sabbath, but change the day of its celebration
from the <i>seventh</i> to the <i>first</i> day of the week, we
would say, that while from the Law only you infer
<span class="pagenum">{15-6}</span>
any obligation to sabbatize at all, yet make the particular
time of sabbatizing to stand upon New Testament
authority, we do not see how you can relieve
yourselves from the charge of departing from the
great principle contended for by Baptists, viz. That
whatever is commanded by an institution, is to be
learned from the law of the institution, and not from
other sources. On this principle, you reject the logic
of Pedobaptists, who, while they find the ordinance
of <i>baptism</i> in the New Testament, go back to the law
of <i>circumcision</i> to determine the subjects. You tell
them, and very justly too, that the <i>law</i> of the institution
is the <i>only rule</i> of obedience. But do you not
fall into the same error when the argument has respect
to the Sabbath? We can see no more fitness
in applying the law of the Sabbath to the first day of
the week, than in applying the law of circumcision to
the subjects of baptism. For the law of circumcision
was not more expressly confined to the fleshly seed of
Abraham, than was the law of the Sabbath to the seventh
day of the week. The true principle is, that
every institution is to be explained and regulated by
its own law. Therefore, if the first day of the week
is an institution binding upon us, the law to regulate
its observance should be looked for where we find the
institution. Be pleased, brethren, to review this argument,
and see if you are not treading on Pedobaptist
ground.</p>

<p>In justification of this change of the day, we often
hear you plead the example of Christ and his apostles.
But where do we find any thing to this effect in their
example? Did the apostles <i>sabbatize</i> on the first day
of the week? Did the churches which were organized
by them do so? Observe, the question between
you and us is <span class="smcap">not</span>, Did they <i>meet together</i> and <i>hold
worship</i> on that day? <span class="smcap">but</span>, Did they <i>sabbatize</i>? that
<span class="pagenum">{15-7}</span>
is, Did they <span class="smcap">rest from their labor</span> on the first day
of the week? Did they observe it <span class="smcap">as</span> a Sabbath?
This is the true issue. We have often asked this
question, but the only answer that we have received
has been, <i>that they assembled for worship</i>. But this
is not a candid way of meeting the point. It is in reality
an answer to a very different question from the
one we ask. Brethren, act out your own principles.
Come up fairly to the question. When you ask a
Pedobaptist, Did Christ baptize or authorize the baptism
of little children? you expect him to make some
other reply than, "<i>He put his hands on them, and
prayed</i>." When you ask, Did the apostles baptize
unconscious babes? you are not well pleased with the
reply, <i>They baptized households</i>. Your question was
with regard to <i>infants</i>&mdash;the <i>baptism</i> of them. If,
therefore, when we ask you, Did the apostles and
primitive Christians <i>sabbatize</i> on the first day of the
week? you merely reply as above, we do not see but
you are guilty of the very same sophistry you are so
ready to charge upon your Pedobaptist brethren.
Your adroit evasion of the real question seems to
place you much in the same predicament as were the
Pharisees, when Christ asked them whence was the
baptism of John. It appears as if you reasoned with
yourselves, and said, "If we shall say they <i>did</i> sabbatize
on the first day of the week, the evidence will be
called for, and we cannot find it; but if we shall say
they did <i>not</i>, we fear the day will lose its sacredness
in the eyes of the people." We do not by any means
wish to charge you with a Pharisaic lack of principle,
but we put it to your sober judgment, whether your
position is not an awkward one. Brethren, reconsider
this point, and see if you are not on Pedobaptist
ground.</p>

<p>If the apostles did not sabbatize on the first day of
<span class="pagenum">{15-8}</span>
the week, then it follows, as a matter of course, that,
whatever notoriety or dignity belonged to that day,
they did not regard it as a substitute for the Sabbath.
Consequently, unless the Sabbath law was entirely abrogated
by the death of Christ, the old Sabbath, as
instituted in Paradise, and rehearsed from Sinai, continues
yet binding, as "the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God."</p>

<p>But more than this. Even if it could be proved,
that the apostles and primitive Christians <i>did</i> actually
regard the first day of the week <i>as a Sabbath</i>, it
would not follow that the old Sabbath is no longer in
force, unless it could be proved that they considered
the new as a <span class="smcap">substitute</span> for the old; or, that so far
as the particular day was concerned, it was of a <span class="smcap">ceremonial</span>
character. But where do we find proof for
either of these points? In the whole record of the
transactions and teachings of the apostles, where do
we find this idea of <i>substitution</i>? No where. Where
do we find evidence that, so far as the <i>particular day</i>
was concerned, it was <i>ceremonial</i>, and therefore to
cease at the death of Christ? No where. The argument
that proves the <i>Sabbath law</i> not to be ceremonial,
proves the same of the <i>day</i>. Did the <i>Sabbath
law</i> originate in Paradise, when man was innocent,
and had no need of a Redeemer? So did the
<i>day</i>. It was then sanctified and blessed. Does the
<i>Sabbath law</i> take cognizance of the relation on which
all the precepts of the moral law are founded, viz.
the relation we sustain to God as <i>creatures</i> to <i>Creator</i>?
So does the <i>day</i>. It is a memorial of this relation, and
of the rest entered into by God after he, by his work,
had established the relation. It appears, then, that
neither the <i>Sabbath law</i>, nor the <i>day</i> it enjoins, was
of a ceremonial character. True, it is not <i>moral</i>, in
the strictest sense, but rather <i>positive</i>. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum">{15-9}</span>
by divine appointment it is in the same category with
the moral law, and must be considered a part of it.
If this reasoning is correct&mdash;and if it is not, we hope
you will point it out&mdash;it would not follow that the old
Sabbath is done away, because Christ and his apostles
sabbatized on the first day of the week; but only that
there are <i>two</i> Sabbaths instead of <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>But could Christ or his apostles consistently alter
the law of the Sabbath? In all his ministry, Christ
acted under the <i>appointment</i> of the Father, and according
to such <i>restrictions</i> as were contained in the
law and the prophets. By those restrictions, no laws
were to be set aside at his coming, except such as
were peculiar to the Jewish economy; such as
"meats, and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal
ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation."
Heb. 9:10. To set aside these, the law gave the
Messiah an express grant. Heb. 10:9. But the
very moment he should attempt to go beyond the
limits of that grant, he would destroy all evidence
of his being the Messiah promised and appointed.
For it was by his exact conformity to the law, that his
claims were established. Hence, early in his ministry,
he declared that he "came not to <i>destroy</i> the law
or the prophets." Matt. 5:17. Most cheerfully do
we recognize him as God over all, and blessed forever;
yet we are well satisfied that, even in virtue of his
divinity, he could not consistently set aside any laws
except those which were "a shadow of things to
come." Otherwise we should have God <i>denying</i> himself&mdash;God
<i>contradicting</i> himself! The New Testament
records not a single instance of his claiming a
right to do so. When he avowed himself Lord of the
Sabbath, he only claimed to determine what was the
proper method of keeping it&mdash;what were breaches of
it, and what were not. The Sabbath was made <i>for</i>
<span class="pagenum">{15-10}</span>
man, and consequently it was his prerogative to decide
what acts and duties answered to the nature and design
of the institution. <i>Therefore</i>, the Son of Man is
Lord of the Sabbath. Mark 2:28.</p>

<p>In regard to the obligation resulting from apostolic
example, it appears to us that you have fallen into
some errors. We are not convinced that the example
of the apostles can be justly pleaded for any thing
else than the order and arrangement of the <i>church</i>.
However proper it may be to imitate them in other
respects&mdash;in the duties of the moral law, for instance&mdash;yet,
if it were not known to be proper, independent
of their example, we cannot suppose their example
would make it so. We must first ascertain, by some
settled and infallible rule, whether their practice is
worthy of imitation. In regard to the ordering of
<i>church affairs</i>, there can be no doubt, for they were
sent upon this very errand, with the promise of the
Holy Spirit to qualify them for the work. But the
Sabbath is not a <i>church ordinance</i>. It is not an institution
for the church <i>as such</i>, but for <i>all mankind</i>.
All reasoning with reference to it, from apostolic example,
must therefore be very inconclusive. Even if
we should admit that the <i>church</i> is bound by such example
to regard the first day of the week, yet this
is the utmost extent to which our admissions can go.
We cannot see how the institution becomes binding
upon the world at large. Consequently, we are compelled
to maintain, that an institution which was originally
given for all mankind, remains unaltered. We
are willing that the example and practice of the apostles
should regulate the <i>church</i> as to its ordinances
and government, and herein we claim to follow them
as strictly as you do; but when they are pleaded for
any thing more, we want first to know whether they
conform to the express law of God. Otherwise we
<span class="pagenum">{15-11}</span>
must consider them as no more binding than an apostle's
quarrel with Barnabas. Acts 15:39.</p>

<p>If this argument is well founded, we are led to a
very satisfactory disposal of a question often proposed,
viz., Why do we never read in the New Testament
of Christian assemblies being convened <i>as such</i> on the
Sabbath? For if the Sabbath be not a <i>church ordinance</i>,
but an institution for mankind at large, it can
be of no importance for us to know what Christian
assemblies <i>as such</i> did with regard to it. All that is
of real importance for us to know, is the precise bearing
of the institution upon man <i>as</i> man&mdash;upon man <i>as</i>
a rational and accountable creature. On this point the
information is clear and decisive.</p>

<p>The controversy between us and you appears to
be brought down to a very narrow compass. <i>Did the
Apostles and primitive Christians sabbatize on the first
day of the week?</i> And, <i>Is it the duty of all men to
imitate their example, or only the</i> <span class="smcap">Church</span>? If, upon
a solemn and prayerful consideration of this subject,
you are persuaded that there is no proof that the early
Christians regarded the first day as a Sabbath, (substituted
in place of the seventh,) and will honestly
avow your conviction, we have no fear that the controversy
will be prolonged. For, should you still be
of opinion that some sort of notoriety was attached to
the day, and that Christians met for worship, we shall
not be very solicitous to dispute the point. The apostolic
rule, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his
own mind," will then govern us. See Rom. 14:5, 6.
Our concern is not that you keep the first day of the
week, but that you keep it <i>in place of the Sabbath</i>,
thus making void the commandment of God. If once
you discover, that Sunday is not the Sabbath by divine
appointment, and therefore cannot be enforced upon
the conscience, we are persuaded that your deep sense
<span class="pagenum">{15-12}</span>
of the necessity of such an institution, will soon bring
you to the observance of the one originally appointed.</p>

<p class="gap-above">II. But we proceed to address those of you who
regard the sabbatic law as having been nailed to the
cross, and consider the first day of the week as an
institution entirely new, regulated as to its observance
wholly by the New Testament.</p>

<p>You, whom we now address, are exempt from some
of the inconsistencies which we have exposed; but
your theory labors under very serious difficulties, and
is to be regarded, on the whole, as more obnoxious to
the interests of religion, than the one we have been
considering.</p>

<p>According to your position, the New Testament recognizes
no Sabbath at all. Do not start at this
charge. That it is repugnant to your feelings, we
allow. You have never thought of any thing else than
<i>entire abstinence from labor</i> on the first day of the
week. It is your day of <i>rest</i>, as well as <i>worship</i>.
But on what ground do you make it a day of rest?
What <i>example</i> have you for doing so? What <i>law</i> of
the New Testament requires you to lay aside all your
secular business? As sin is the transgression of the
law, and where no law is there is no transgression&mdash;1&nbsp;John
3:4, Rom. 4:15&mdash;how do you make it appear
to be sin to work on the day in question? It is
by the commandment that sin becomes exceeding sinful.
Rom. 7:13. By what commandment do you
make it appear sinful to work on Sunday? These
are questions of the highest importance.</p>

<p>Now suppose one of your brethren attends public
worship on the first day of the week, and&mdash;to make
his conformity to what is supposed to be apostolic example
as perfect as possible&mdash;participates in the breaking
of bread. He then goes home, and labors diligently
<span class="pagenum">{15-13}</span>
till the day is closed. By what law will you
convince him of sin? Not the law of the Sabbath as
contained in the Decalogue, for that, you hold to be
abolished. Not any law of the New Testament which
says, "Keep the first day of the week holy; in it thou
shalt not do any work," for there is no such law. Not
the law of apostolic example, for there is no proof that
the apostles ever gave such example. The very
utmost that you can with any show of reason pretend
of their example is, that they met together for worship
and breaking of bread. To this example your
brother has conformed to the very letter&mdash;who can
say he has not in spirit also? What now will you do
with him? "The Bible, and the Bible only, is the religion
of Protestants." The Bible, therefore, is the
Rule by which he is to be tried. Convict him of sin
by this Rule, if you can.</p>

<p>But the case becomes still more difficult, when you
come to apply it to those who are without the pale of
the church. We have already seen, that apostolic example
concerns merely the ordering and arrangement
of the <i>church</i>. Attempt now to convince the unbeliever
of sin in working on the first day of the week.
In order to do this, charge apostolic example upon
him. What is his reply? "I know not," says he,
"that I am bound to imitate them in this matter. How
does it appear that I am? I will admit, for argument's
sake, that they celebrated the resurrection on
Sunday by religious worship; but they also broke
bread and partook of it by way of celebrating his
death. If their example binds me in one particular,
why not in the other? Prove to me," says he, "that
any but the church assembled on the first day for worship,
and I will do so too. But in the absence of all
such proof, I must conclude that their example has
nothing to do with me; unless, indeed, you can make
<span class="pagenum">{15-14}</span>
it appear, that their example and practice were in conformity
to some law, which commanded them as rational
creatures, independent of their relation to Christ
and his church. When you can produce that law, then
I shall feel bound to obey it, and imitate the apostles
in their obedience to it; but not till then." Such is
the reasoning by which an unbeliever may set aside
all your attempts to charge sin upon him. Where,
brethren, is your law which, like a barbed arrow,
pierces the very soul, and fastens guilt upon the conscience?
Where is that law which speaks out its
thunders, saying, "Thus saith the Almighty God, the
Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth, It is the Sabbath
day; in it thou shalt not do any work?" To throw
aside the law, which cuts and flames every way, reaching
soul and spirit, joints and marrow, in order to deal
with the ungodly by mere apostolic example, is like
muffling the sword, lest it should give a deadly wound.
Apostolic example is indeed powerful with those whose
hearts have been made tender by the Spirit of God,
but with others powerless.</p>

<p>We are persuaded, brethren, that your conscientious
scruples about laboring on the first day of the week,
never resulted from the mere contemplation of apostolic
example. Such example, it is true, is all the law
you acknowledge; but this is the theory you have
adopted since you came to maturity, and began to
think for yourselves. Your scruples have an earlier
and different origin. They commenced with your
childhood, when you were taught to consider the day
as holy time. It was then carefully instilled into your
mind, that God had, by express law, forbidden you to
desecrate the day, and that you would incur his displeasure
in case you should do so. The idea was then
imbibed, that if you did not keep the day, you would
violate the fourth commandment. This idea has
<span class="pagenum">{15-15}</span>
grown with your growth, and strengthened with your
strength. It has obtained such commanding influence
over your feelings, that you cannot comfortably forbear
keeping a day of rest, though your theory does not
require it. Even to this day a strong impression rests
upon your minds, that the fourth commandment contains
much of moral excellence&mdash;too much to be
thrown altogether away, notwithstanding your system
of theology teaches its abrogation. Such is the true
secret of your tenderness of conscience. Apostolic
example has in reality nothing to do with it. Following
the secret monitions of conscience, your prosperity
is promoted in spite of your theological system. But
sound reason discovers, that your experience and your
theory are in opposition to each other. Some of the
more thinking ones among you are aware of this, and
are continually aiming at such a modification of their
theory, that their experience will harmonize with
it. But be assured, that there will be an everlasting
conflict, till you are brought to acknowledge fully and
heartily the claims of the sabbatic law.</p>

<p>We are aware of that system of theology which
regards the New Testament as furnishing the only
code of laws by which men are bound since the death
of Christ. We have looked at this doctrine with attention;
and so far as the order, government, and ordinances
of the <i>church</i> are concerned, we admit its
truth. As the laws and ordinances of the <i>Jewish</i> church
were determined by the <i>Old</i> Testament, so the laws
and ordinances of the <i>Christian</i> church are determined
solely by the <i>New</i> Testament. Therefore, we
should say at once, the argument is yours, if the Sabbath
were a church ordinance. In such case, however,
none but the church has a Sabbath. But the
question is not concerning church ordinances. In
these we follow the New Testament as closely as
<span class="pagenum">{15-16}</span>
yourselves. The question is concerning an institution
which has respect to mankind at large&mdash;to man <i>as</i>
man; for the Saviour teaches us that the Sabbath was
made <i>for</i> man. Now, it will be a very hard matter to
prove, that when men as rational creatures are concerned,
the only code of laws by which they are bound
is the New Testament. Let us put the matter to the
test. How will you prove that it is unlawful for a man
to marry his sister, his daughter, or any other of near
kin? The New Testament utters not a word on the
subject. It is not enough to say, It is implied in the
law which forbids adultery; for it must first be proved
to be a species of adultery to do so. Nor will it
do to say, The common sense of mankind is a sufficient
law on the subject; for the moment we suppose that
its unlawfulness is to be determined in this way, we
abandon the argument that the New Testament is the
only code of laws, and resort to the common sense of
mankind as furnishing a part of the code. But if the
common sense of mankind shall furnish a part of the
code by which we are bound, who shall undertake to
say how large a part? Besides, on this principle, the
book of divine revelation is not complete and perfect.
It is a lamp to our feet only in part, and the common
sense of mankind makes out the deficiency! You
are, therefore, driven to take your stand again upon
the New Testament. Finding you there again, we
repeat the question, <i>How do you prove by your code
that a man may not marry his sister?</i> It is impossible.
You must, of necessity, look to that division of
the Scriptures usually called the Old Testament; for
the New says not one word about it.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the 18th chapter of the book of
Leviticus, and we shall find a collection of laws exactly
to the point. "None of you shall approach to
any that is near of kin to him," &amp;c. v.&nbsp;6. The degrees
<span class="pagenum">{15-17}</span>
of kindred are then expressly marked. Will it
be objected, that these laws were given particularly to
the Jews, and to no other people? We admit they
were given to the Jews, as indeed was the whole system
of revelation in that age; but we cannot admit
that they concerned no other class of people. For it
is expressly shown in that chapter, that the matters of
which they took cognizance, were regarded as abominations
in the Gentiles. Because of such things, the
fierce wrath of Jehovah came down upon the Canaanites,
and they were cast out from the land as loathsomeness.
v.&nbsp;24, 30. If these things were viewed
as abominable in the Canaanites, they surely were not
<i>ceremonial</i> pollutions. They were not mere <i>Jewish</i>
laws. The fallacy of the doctrine is therefore sufficiently
exposed.</p>

<p>We think you have fallen into error concerning the
nature and design of that division of the Scriptures
commonly called the New Testament. We regard it
not as the <i>Law Book</i> of mankind, in the strict and
proper sense; but rather as a <i>Treatise on Justification</i>,
or an <i>Expose of the Way of Salvation</i>, in which are
contained such references to the law, and such quotations
from it, as are necessary to the complete elucidation
of the subject. The preparation of this treatise
was of necessity delayed until the great Sacrifice
for sin had been offered, and our High Priest had entered
into the holy place. For, as the sacrifice and intercession
of our High Priest constitute the sole foundation
of our justification, so "the way into the holiest
of all was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle
was yet standing." Heb. 9:8. So much of
the plan of salvation was illustrated to the people, as
could be by means of the ritual service; and that, together
with the prophecies, laid a foundation for them
to <i>believe</i> that, <i>in some way or other</i>, they would be
<span class="pagenum">{15-18}</span>
just before God. So that by <i>faith</i> the patriarchs were
justified. Heb. 11. They knew it was to be <i>somehow</i>
through the work of Him who was typified and promised
as the great Redeemer. But they could not understand
the plan until the Redeemer came and died
for them.</p>

<p><i>Because</i> this expose of the way of salvation could
not be made until after the death of the High Priest,
<i>therefore</i> it was not proper to organize gospel churches.
The only church that was suitable for that age was
found in the Jewish nation, and from its very nature
was unfit for the world at large. It was, therefore,
confined to that people. Moreover, because it was
not proper to organize gospel churches until the way
of salvation was fully laid open, it was also not proper
to lay down the laws and ordinances of the church
until that time. This accounts for the laws of the
church being found only in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Now, if the New Testament is to be regarded as
an exhibition of the way of salvation, with such references
to the Old as are necessary for the elucidation
of the subject, rather than as the Law Book for mankind
at large, the idea that the Sabbath ought not to
be looked for in the Old Testament falls to the ground.
Nevertheless, to some minds it appears strange, that
while the New Testament writers mention all the other
duties of the Decalogue, this of Sabbath keeping is apparently
omitted. In speaking of the sins of which Christians
were guilty before their conversion, not one word is
said about Sabbath breaking, though upon other sins they
dwell with emphasis. But this admits of a very easy
solution. Those writers addressed two classes of converts&mdash;those
from among the Jews, and those from
among the Gentiles. As to the former, they were already
rigid to an extreme in keeping the Sabbath.
All that was necessary to do in their case, was to vindicate
<span class="pagenum">{15-19}</span>
the institution from Pharisaic austerities, and
determine what was lawful to be done, and what was
not lawful. This was done by Christ. But as for the
Gentile converts, to charge them with having been
guilty of the sin of Sabbath breaking in their state of
heathenism, would have been manifest impropriety.
For the Sabbath being for the most part a <i>positive</i>
rather than a <i>moral</i> precept, it could not be known
without a revelation. But as the Gentiles had no revelation,
this is a good reason why the apostle dwelt not
upon this sin to charge it upon them, but only upon
those which were more obviously breaches of the
Moral Law. Thus it appears, there was no necessity
for any more particular mention of the Sabbath to be
made in the New Testament than what is made.</p>

<p>But it is not our object in this Address to cover the
whole field of argument. We design simply, by presenting
some of the strong points, and exposing your
inconsistencies, to stir up your attention to the subject.
We are sure that the great majority of you have never
given it a thorough investigation. For a complete discussion
of the whole ground, we refer you to our publications.
Will you read them? Will you anxiously
inquire, What is truth? Will you pray over the matter,
saying, "Lord, what wilt thou have us to do?"
Or, will you sleep over it, as if it were of no great
practical importance?</p>

<p class="gap-above">III. But we must address that class of Baptists who
consider neither the Old nor the New Testament to
impose any obligation to observe a day of rest, and
advocate one merely on the ground of expediency.
In some sections of our country, Baptists would consider
it almost a slander upon their denomination to
intimate that there were persons among them of such
anti-sabbath principles. But any one who is conversant
<span class="pagenum">{15-20}</span>
with the order at large, knows very well that it
is true. There are those who boldly avow such doctrine,
and many others who do not deny that it is their
real sentiment, though they are not forward to proclaim
it upon the house-tops. Whether this class embraces
a very large proportion of the denomination, it
is not necessary to inquire. It is our impression, that
the proportion is sufficiently large to justify an effort
for their conversion to right views of Divine Truth.</p>

<p>If there is no day of rest enjoined by divine authority,
and the observance of one rests wholly upon
expediency, we see no reason, except that the voice
of the multitude is against it, why you cannot as well
observe the <i>seventh</i> as the <i>first</i> day of the week.
There would be no sacrifice of conscience in so doing,
while it would be a tribute of respect to those who
feel that the keeping of the seventh day is an indispensable
part of duty. But it is not on this principle,
particularly, that we desire you to change your ground.
Feeling that it is not <i>our party</i> that must be honored,
but rather <i>divine truth</i>, and our party only <i>for the
sake of</i> the truth, we would much rather correct your
doctrinal views.</p>

<p>Of course, you do not deny that a day of rest was
once enjoined upon God's chosen people. It is only
under the gospel that you suppose all distinction of
days to be annihilated. If, then, it is <i>expedient</i> that a
day of rest should be observed, it follows irresistibly,
that the annihilation of all distinction in days, by the
gospel, was very <span class="smcap">inexpedient</span>! And thus, whatever
blessings the gospel dispensation brings to the human
race, a strict following out of its principles would be
<span class="smcap">inexpedient</span>! And, farther, that the <i>law</i>, which enjoined
a day of rest, had more of an eye to expediency
than the <i>gospel</i> has! Consequently, that the gospel,
though declared to be <i>faultless</i>, and capable of
<span class="pagenum">{15-21}</span>
<i>perfecting</i> those who believe, must nevertheless, <span class="smcap">for
expediency's sake</span>, borrow a little help from the
abrogated rites of the law! In other words, God, in
setting aside a day of rest, committed an oversight,
and left his work for man to mend! Brethren, we
see not how it is possible for you to escape such monstrous
conclusions. They are the legitimate result of
your principles&mdash;principles which you must have adopted
without considering where they would land you.
For we are not disposed to believe you so completely
destitute of piety, as willingly to abide by the result
of them. We entreat you to reconsider them, and
adopt such as are more in accordance with the spirit
of our holy religion.</p>

<p>When you advocate the observance of a day of rest
on the ground of <i>expediency</i>, we are persuaded that
you do so in view of the bearing you perceive it to
have upon the well being of mankind. But still the
question will arise, Has the gospel less regard to the
well being of mankind than the law had? Look at
the humanity of the sabbatic institution. How necessary
that both man and beast should rest one day in
seven. How evident that they cannot endure uninterrupted
toil. How perfectly well established, that, if
doomed to constant labor, they sink under the premature
exhaustion of their powers. So well is this established,
that we cannot put such a low estimate upon
your judgment as to suppose it necessary to enter
upon any proof of it. But the question returns, Does
the gospel breathe less humanity than the law? Or,
consider the bearing of the institution upon the interests
of religion. It affords opportunity for men to be
instructed in the great things which pertain to their
salvation; and if there were no Sabbath to call them
away from their labors, it would be impossible to
bring religious instruction into contact with their
<span class="pagenum">{15-22}</span>
minds. Does the gospel afford less advantage in this
respect than the law did? Did the law provide a season
for instructing the people in religion as it <i>then</i>
stood? and does the gospel provide no season for instructing
them in religion as it <i>now</i> stands? Must
they be instructed in <i>types</i>, but not in the <i>substance</i>?&mdash;in
<i>prophecy</i>, but not in the <i>fulfillment</i> of prophecy?
No one will be responsible for the affirmative of these
questions.</p>

<p>If the New Dispensation actually has abrogated the
Sabbath, we do not believe that it is <i>expedient</i> to observe
it. We cannot believe, however, that an institution
so important to the civilization, refinement, and
religious prosperity of mankind, has been abrogated.
We refer you to our publications, and to the publications
of those who have, in common with us, defended
the perpetuity of the sabbatic law; and we entreat
you to reconsider your ground. The doctrine of expediency!
What a fruitful source of corruption has
it been to the church of God! There is not an anti-christian,
popish abomination, but what pleads something
of this kind. Do, dear brethren, let it be expunged
from your creed.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="smcap">Brethren of the Baptist Denomination</span>: You
are a great and growing people. Your influence is
felt throughout the length and breadth of our land.
We rejoice in your prosperity. "May the Lord
make you to increase and abound in love one towards
another, and toward all men." In your prosperity we
behold, in a measure, our own. Your baptism is our
baptism. Your church government is our government.
Your doctrinal principles are ours; and there
is nothing which constitutes any real ground of separation,
except the great and important subject we now
urge upon your attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{15-23}</span>
The popularity you have gained as a denomination,
however, is not owing to your Sabbath principles. It
is founded entirely on your views concerning the initiating
ordinance of the gospel. These views are
characterized by that perfect simplicity which marks
every divine institution. Hence you have won the affections
of the common people, while, if you had attempted
to operate on them by a more complicated
theory, failure would have been the result.</p>

<p>This induces us to urge upon your notice the <i>exceeding
simplicity</i> of the Sabbatarian argument, compared
with all those theories which stand in opposition
to it. It is adapted to persons of weak capacities, of
whom there are thousands in the kingdom of Christ.
Any illiterate person can open the Bible, and point to
chapter and verse, saying, "The seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God." This is plain; he can
understand it. But tell him that redemption was a
much greater work than creation; that redemption
was finished by the resurrection of Christ; that an
event so important ought to be commemorated; and
that, in order to do this, the day of the Sabbath was
changed from the seventh to the first day of the week;
for all which there is not a single "thus saith the
Lord;" nothing but the uncertain deductions of human
reason. Can he understand it? No. It requires an
elevation of intellect which God has not given him.
The inferences and deductions are beyond his capacities.
How then is he to render an <i>intelligent</i> obedience?
If he conform his practice to the theory thus
set before him, it will not be because he understands
it, but because he is willing to trust the guidance of
his mind to those who, he thinks, know more than he
does himself. This, therefore, is strong internal evidence
that the keeping of the first day is not of God.
For God's Book is adapted not only to those of elevated
<span class="pagenum">{15-24}</span>
intellect, but to the ignorant and rude. Every
thing concerning our practice is plain even to wayfaring
men. Were it otherwise, we should conclude
that the Bible is not an inspired production. If it did
not come down to the capacities of all, we should infer
that it was not made by Him who made all minds.
Indeed, it would not, in such case, be a <i>revelation</i> to
all, but only to the more talented. But it is a revelation
to <i>all</i>; and he that obeys God, must do it for
himself; he that repents and believes, must do so for
himself; and at the great day, every one of us shall
give account for himself unto God. It is of the highest
importance, therefore, that every one know <i>for
himself</i> the foundation of his faith and practice.</p>

<p>In thus urging the simplicity of the argument for
the Sabbath, we are but doing what you do in regard
to Baptism. Compare the cases. A man of considerable
intellect can reason from the Abrahamic covenant,
lay propositions together, and draw inferences
and deductions, until, finally, he makes it pretty clear
to his own mind, that the children of the flesh, these
are the children of God; Paul to the contrary notwithstanding.
But how is it with some good old Baptist
sister, who can hardly join two ideas together, and
draw a logical inference from them? Why, she cannot
tell about this reasoning from the Abrahamic covenant.
It is something she does not understand. But
she can open her Bible, and point to chapter and verse
for believer's baptism. She puts her finger upon something
that is just adapted to her capacities. As she
has a soul to save, an obedience to render, and an account
to give, all for herself, her practice is accordingly.
Brethren, think this matter over, and see whether
your reasoning on the Sabbath is not very much akin
to that of those who reason from the Abrahamic covenant
to Baptism. Think seriously, whether it does
<span class="pagenum">{15-25}</span>
not render <i>intelligent</i> obedience impossible to vast
numbers of Christians. Think whether a course of
reasoning which darkens a very simple subject, is not
more specious than solid.</p>

<p>Again, your children are to be early instructed in
this matter, How do you succeed in making them
understand it? Is your little child capable of comprehending
all this argument, which you found upon the
finishing of redemption by the resurrection of Christ?
Can you point him to any plain passage, where Christ
authorizes a change of the Sabbath? How do you
feel when the little creature says, in the simplicity of
his heart, "Father, mother, does not the fourth commandment
require the observance of the seventh day
of the week? But do we not keep the first day? I
should think this is not keeping the commandment."
One would think you would be forcibly reminded of
that scripture, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
thou hast ordained strength." Ps. 8:2.</p>

<p>The extensive operations in which you are engaged
for the conversion of the world, render it in the highest
degree important that you should not err on a question
like this. If you are right, you ought to be very
certain of it. Among the heathen, you are extending
the observance of Sunday as a sacred day. If you
are thus sowing the seeds of error instead of truth,
the evils who can calculate? Hence you cannot too
early begin to review your ground. Consider the difficulties
your missionaries already have to encounter,
because of unscriptural sentiments propagated among
the heathen by those who nevertheless loved their
souls. The poor, perishing idolaters are witnesses of
the clashing of doctrine between Jesus Christ's men,
and they ask, "<i>Why is this? You have come to give
us a gospel which professes to make its followers 'perfect
in one,' and yet you yourselves are divided.</i>" You
<span class="pagenum">{15-26}</span>
cannot in conscience abandon your principles, however,
nor dare you, in your translations, give to a sentence
or a particle one single turn, which will not fully
express the mind of the Holy Spirit. Dare you, then,
without feeling the most entire certainty, teach them
that God says, "Remember the first day of the week
to keep it holy?" The responsibility of the missionary,
in this respect, is not less than where his translation is
concerned. Does he feel the same awful sense of responsibility?</p>

<p>From the heathen turn to the contemplation of the
Jewish nation. The time cannot be far distant, when
those who, "as touching the election, are beloved for
the fathers' sakes," shall be called to behold the glory
of God, in the face of Him they have so long rejected.
But in order to this, a voice from the divine word cries,
"Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the
stumbling block out of the way of my people." Have
Christians seriously considered what this stumbling-block
is? For our own part, we are persuaded that
nothing can be more justly called by this name, than
the general abandonment, on the part of Christians, of
the Sabbath of the Lord. The Jews, taking it for
granted, without examination, that this abandonment
is really taught by the Christian religion, suppose that
its author cannot be the true Messiah. They have
seen, through every period of their nation's history,
that God has put signal honor upon this institution.
They have seen its sacredness elevated high above
that of the ceremonial institutions. They have heard
their prophets dwell upon the profanation of it as the
crying sin of the land, on account of which the sore
judgments of Heaven came down upon it. It is true,
some teach that the whole Mosaic system was clothed
with as much sacredness as the Sabbath; and that it
was not for the sin of Sabbath breaking, any more than
<span class="pagenum">{15-27}</span>
for a disregard of the ritual service in general, that
they suffered the wrath of Jehovah. But such persons
must have paid only a superficial attention to the
subject. The attentive reader cannot fail to be struck
with the fact, that while in the prophets the Sabbath
is exalted as of vast importance to the nation, and all
its prosperity, and the favor of God, seemingly, suspended
on the proper keeping of it, ceremonial usages
are comparatively depreciated.</p>

<p>Since the Sabbath holds such a sacredness throughout
the ancient oracles of God&mdash;since the Israelites
have taken their lessons of obedience to it under "the
rod of his wrath"&mdash;since no grant was given to the
Messiah to set it aside, nor the least intimation ever
made to the Jews that it would be set aside&mdash;can we
wonder that they think that teacher to be an impostor
who should break this commandment, and teach men
so?</p>

<p>But there is a crisis approaching&mdash;the day is near,
and it hasteth greatly&mdash;when it will be indispensable
that all those who truly love the Lord Jesus Christ,
have their "loins girt about with truth." Popery is
preparing for another desperate struggle. The great
principle of the Reformation, that "the Scriptures are
the only rule of faith," is to be discussed anew. In the
Church of England, this discussion has already commenced.
Rome has opened her sluices, and anti-christian
corruption again threatens to flood the
church of God. As the water naturally seeks such
channels as may be already prepared, so will it be
with this doctrine. What branch of Zion will be next
troubled? Probably that which makes the next widest
departure from the great Protestant principle. Then
that which is next in order; and so on. For it can
not reasonably be expected to stop, until it reach that
order of people which is governed by the Bible alone.
<span class="pagenum">{15-28}</span>
Upon all others the desolation must be more or less
extensive. For those who acknowledge the principle
of departing from the Bible in ever so small a degree,
may be expected to exemplify it to an indefinite extent,
when the circumstances of the times are so modified
as to give occasion for it. As for yourselves, you
do not avow the <i>principle</i> of departing from the Scriptures,
but profess to hold it in abhorrence. The language
of your <i>creeds</i> is explicit on this point; and we
know of no denomination so forward to plead a strict
conformity to this principle as yourselves. Yet it is impossible
for you to pretend, with any show of modesty,
that the Scriptures expressly enjoin the keeping of
Sunday as a Sabbath to the Lord. You cannot say,
from Scripture authority, that the apostles observed it
as such. Nevertheless, your creed declares that it ought
to be so observed; and your practice accords with
your creed. Wherefore, it is as evident as mathematical
demonstration, that you do depart from the great
Protestant principle. Consequently, if our views be
correct in regard to the crisis which is at hand, the
time cannot be far distant, when your own denomination
will in some modified form be affected with the
deprecated evil, and you will be compelled to abandon
every principle and practice which can give it the
smallest advantage.</p>

<p>Do you think, brethren, that in your present position
you are prepared for the great struggle? When
the Puseyite, replying to those who contend for the
Protestant maxim, refers to the observance of Sunday,
and says, "Here we are absolutely compelled to resort
to the aid of ancient usage, as recorded, not by
the inspired, but by the uninspired writers," are
you ready for the issue? Can you confute what he
says? When another one says, "The <i>seventh</i> day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; we celebrate the
<span class="pagenum">{15-29}</span>
<i>first</i>. Was this done by divine command? No. I do
not recollect that the Saviour, or the apostles, say we
shall rest on the first day of the week instead of the
seventh;" and then concludes, "The same reasons
which urge you to dissent from the observance of the
three grand festivals of the Church of England, ought
to operate with you respecting the Sabbath;"&mdash;are
you prepared to join issue with him? Can you justify
yourselves on your own principles? If you can,
we will confess our short-sightedness. But indeed we
fear, we tremble, in view of the crisis which is approaching,
when we look at the traditional usages prevailing
among Christians, and consider with what a
tenacious grasp they are held. O Lord God Almighty!
thou who hast sworn that 'thy kindness shall
not depart from thy church, nor the covenant of thy
peace be removed,' let not thy truth fall in the contest.</p>

<p>We mean not to goad your feelings, by charging
upon you any of the abominations of Popery. We
are sure you would not cherish one of them, if you
were conscious of it. But we take it for granted,
that those who are forward to take the mote out of
their brother's eye, are willing to have the beam taken
out of their own. You have charged pedobaptist denominations,
over and over, with upholding popery's
chief pillar. You have told them, that their zeal
against the man of sin would avail them but little,
until they first rid themselves of his traditions. You
have talked feelingly of the sin of encumbering the
ordinances of God with human inventions. You have
read the church of Christ many a good lesson on the
importance of holding the truth in its purity. In all
this you have, doubtless, been sincere. We have no
fault to find with you; for you have only followed the
Bible direction, "Cry aloud, spare not, show my people
<span class="pagenum">{15-30}</span>
their transgression." In conformity with this direction,
we would endeavor to act our part as faithful
reprovers. Yet our desire is, to do it with meekness,
considering ourselves, lest we also be tempted. It
may be&mdash;we know not&mdash;that some of the abominations
of the man of sin are cleaving to us. If so, "let
the righteous smite us, it shall be a kindness; let them
reprove us, it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
break our head."</p>

<p>Turn, brethren, to the seventh chapter of the prophecy
of Daniel, and twenty-fifth verse. You there find
one spoken of who "shall speak great words against the
Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most
High, <i>and think to change</i> <span class="smcap">times</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">laws</span>." You
have had no difficulty in finding in this prophecy a reference
to the law of baptism, as one of the <i>laws</i>
which this great power has changed; but you have
not shown satisfactorily what are the <i>times</i>. You have
usually referred them to the numerous festivals and
holy-days, which have been multiplied by the church
of Rome. But these were <i>times</i> <span class="smcap">established</span>; not
<i>times</i> <span class="smcap">changed</span>. Will you please to expound this passage
a little more clearly? Will you tell us whether,
under the gospel, there is any sacred time except the
Sabbath? We will not be unreasonably confident,
but we are much mistaken, if you can give any clear
and satisfactory construction to this prophecy, without
finding that something of Rome still cleaves to you.</p>

<p>Suffer us here to declare our conviction, that you
could take no more effectual step toward converting
the Christian world to right views about baptism,
than to embrace the Sabbath of the Bible. In your
discussions with Pedobaptists, you are constantly referred
to the change of the Sabbath, as proof that
some things may be binding which the Scriptures do
not expressly enjoin. You have never met this argument
<span class="pagenum">{15-31}</span>
fairly and fully. To be sure, you always make
an attempt to meet it. But how do you do it? By
proving that Christ expressly enjoined his followers to
<i>sabbatize</i> on the first day of the week? By showing
from express Scripture testimony, that the apostles
<i>did actually rest from their labors</i> on that day? No.
Neither of these things have you ever shown; nor
can you show them. The whole head and front of
your proof&mdash;if proof it may be called&mdash;amount only
to this; that the apostles and primitive Christians <i>met
together for worship</i> on that day. It is true, by such
a course you have generally talked your opponents
into silence, because by exposing fully the defect of
your reply, it would only render their own transgression
the more glaring. But while you <i>silenced</i> them,
you did not <i>convince</i> them. While they saw that for
one of <i>your own</i> customs you could not plead a "thus
saith the Lord," they felt comparatively easy under
all your rebukes, and naturally enough thought it not
<i>very</i> important, that <i>they</i> should have a "thus saith
the Lord" for the sprinkling of babes.</p>

<p>But a most important consideration, in view of this
subject, is the influence of your large and powerful
denomination upon an unconverted world. Whatever
your theory about the perpetuity of the sabbatic law&mdash;whatever
your doubts and scruples about the use of
the term <i>Sabbath</i> under the gospel&mdash;you cannot rid
yourselves of a deep sense of the importance of a
day of rest to the world at large. Hence the resolutions
of your churches and conventional bodies, with
regard to the profanation of what you call the Lord's
day. Hence your plain, out-spoken censures of running
cars, stages, steamboats, and other public conveyances,
on this day. Hence your griefs and lamentations
over those who make it a day of recreation or
mirth. Hence your readiness to coöperate with those
<span class="pagenum">{15-32}</span>
bodies which are organized to suppress, if possible,
the violation of what is called the Sabbath. We admire
the <i>principle</i> which governs you in all this; but
we lament that it is not regulated by a better understanding
of the subject. If you would promote right
principles, you must be careful that your proofs, and
examples for illustration, are pertinent and free from
all uncertainty. We are fully persuaded, that your
<i>Recommendations</i> and <i>Pledges</i>, your <i>Resolutions</i> and
<i>Associational Acts</i>, will always meet with defeat, until
you can fortify them by a law of God, so clearly expressed,
that it will urge and goad the violator's conscience
wherever he may go. The consciences of
guilty men cannot be reached by the method you are
pursuing. You behold them desecrating the Sunday,
and, in order to make them lay it to heart as a sin,
you bring down upon them&mdash;what? Apostolic example?
New Testament intimations, and far-fetched
inferences? No. None of these do you think of employing.
But the <i>Law</i>, the all-searching, sin-rebuking
<i>Law</i> of God, is the only means you think of in such
a case. Nothing else suits your purpose, be your
<i>theory</i> what it may. But hear their reply. "Is the
law of the commandment upon us <span class="smcap">TO-DAY</span>? That it
was <span class="smcap">yesterday</span>, we allow; for it says, '<i>the seventh
day</i>.' That the law of the commandment lies against
us <i>every</i> day, you will not pretend; but only <i>one</i> day
in seven. If that one day was <i>yesterday</i>, you are
yourselves as guilty as we; and we, therefore, feel
comparatively comfortable. To be sure, some sense
of the necessity of keeping the Sabbath holy, does at
times rest upon our minds; and our consciences, for
the moment, reproach us; but when we see you, and
all the Christian world, living in the neglect of it, we
feel quite easy again, and think our sin to be but a
light one." Such may not be their precise language,
<span class="pagenum">{15-33}</span>
but it is the exact expression of their hearts' feelings.
Thus even the Law fails in your hands, because you
attempt to make it speak <i>what it will not speak</i>.</p>

<p>If you ask <i>us</i>, "Do <i>you</i> meet with success in attempting
to reach the consciences of guilty, unbelieving
men?" we reply, that we have no difficulty, except
so far as you, and the whole body of observers of
the first day, stand in the way. We bring them to
admit, openly and honestly, the claims of God's law,
and a sense of guilt momentarily rests upon them.
But immediately they turn to contemplate <i>your</i> practice,
and their hearts become hardened. We do,
therefore, affectionately, but earnestly, invite you to
consider, how tremendous is your influence toward
perpetuating Sabbath profanation in the land. Your
numbers, your learning, your talents, your wealth,
your general respectability, all combine to operate
with overwhelming effect in this matter.</p>

<p>Our observations, if correct, go to show what a
source of danger the Sunday heresy is to the Moral
Law. The Sabbath is a most important precept of
this law; "the golden <i>clasp</i>," as an old writer quaintly
observes, "which joins the two tables together; the
<i>sinew</i> in the body of laws, which were written with
God's own finger; the intermediate precept, which
participates of the sanctity of both tables, and the due
observance of which is the fulfilling of the whole
law." This important precept is either set aside entirely,
or its edge and keenness so muffled by a
transfer to another day, that the united efforts of the
church can do little or nothing toward impressing it
on the conscience. Here, then, is a relaxation of the
standard of morality; and while the standard is relaxed
with regard to this one precept, in vain do we
look for the Law, as a whole, to appear glorious in
the eyes of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{15-34}</span>
This remark will be strengthened, if we consider
to what inconsistencies the advocates of Sunday are
driven. Some, in their zeal to defend it, even go so
far as to deny the Moral Law to be a rule of conduct
to Christians. Others, though they admit the Law to
be a rule of conduct, cannot relieve themselves of at
least <i>seeming</i> to undervalue it. When the Sabbath
discussion is out of sight, they speak out clearly, and
without equivocation, giving the fullest proof that they
regard the Law as the unchangeable standard of obedience.
But at other times they reason from the
New Dispensation in a manner so vague and indefinite,
that one is puzzled to tell whether they regard the
Gospel as enforcing strict obedience to the Law or
not. Now he that is established in the clear truth, is
hampered with no such difficulties. There is, with
him, not only the naked and abstract admission, that
the Moral Law is unchangeably binding, but there
appears such a beautiful and perfect conformity between
this admission and the principles he inculcates,
that the most common minds are struck with it, and
every doubt is scattered.</p>

<p>While you are fettered by such difficulties, is there
no danger that the Law will lose its sacredness in the
eyes of the people? Surely there is. There is danger,
also, that your system of theology will be corrupted
in other particulars. Error goes not alone.
Could an opinion exist in the mind, circumscribed
and isolated, without affecting any of our other principles,
it would be comparatively harmless. But it is
not more a truth, that a man who utters one falsehood
is obliged to tell twenty more to hide it, than
that he who supports one error is obliged to forge
numberless others to give consistency to his creed. It
is also a truth, which reflection and daily observation
will confirm, that nearly if not quite all the heresies
<span class="pagenum">{15-35}</span>
which ever infested the church of God, are traceable
to some loose notions concerning the Moral Law.
Nothing, therefore, can be more necessary, than that
our creed give the greatest possible prominence to the
Law as a standard of holiness; and that our customs
be in perfect conformity with our creed.</p>

<p>Brethren, can we hope that the subject on which
we have addressed you will receive your prayerful
attention? Almost your entire denomination has slumbered
over it; but may we not hope, that you will
now awake? May we not hope, that it will be discussed
in your private circles, and in your public assemblies;
in your Bible classes, and in your Sunday
schools; that it will be studied by your ministers,
and by the people in general; and that every one
will, in the deep desire of his soul, pray, "Lord, open
thou mine eyes, that I may discern wondrous things
out of thy Law."</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, we see a disposition to pass
it by with cold neglect&mdash;an unwillingness to look the
question in the face&mdash;an attempt, on the part of your
teachers and leaders, to hush it up as a matter of no
importance&mdash;a studied effort to lead the people away
from it, when they are disposed to examine&mdash;or teaching
them that it is the spirit, rather than the letter of
the law that God requires&mdash;we shall be constrained to
apply the language of Him who spake as never man
spake&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Every one that doeth evil hateth the
light, neither cometh to the light, lest his
deeds should be reproved.</span>" John 3:20.</p>

<h3>PREFACE BY THE TRACT SOCIETY.</h3>

</div>

<p>The friends of the Sabbath will doubtless receive this little
volume as a valuable relic of the past&mdash;as a word from one
of the tried and faithful friends of the truth, one who not
only loved the day of God's weekly rest, but greatly delighted
in the promise of a future and glorious sabbatism with the
people of God. Edward Stennet, the author, was the first
of the series of Sabbatarian ministers of that name, who for
four generations continued to be among the foremost of the
Dissenters in England, and whose praise is still in all the
churches. He was an able and devoted minister, but dissenting
from the Established Church, he was deprived of the
means of support; and, his family being large, he applied
himself to the study of medicine, by the practice of which
he was enabled to give his sons a liberal education. He suffered
much of the persecution which the Dissenters were exposed
to at that time, and more especially for his faithful adherence
to the cause of the Sabbath. For this truth, he experienced
tribulation, not only from those in power, by whom
he was a long time kept in prison, but also much distress from
unfriendly dissenting brethren, who strove to destroy his influence,
and ruin his cause. He wrote several treatises upon
the subject of the Sabbath besides this, but they are very rare,
and perhaps cannot all be found in a perfect state of preservation.
It would be well, no doubt, to revive all of them,
and, if practicable, republish them in the same form as this,
that they might be bound together, and placed, as they deserve
to be, in every Sabbath-keeper's library. They all breathe the
genuine spirit of Christianity, and in their day were greatly
conducive to the prosperity of the Sabbath-keeping churches.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL LAW CONTENDED FOR</h3>

<p class="center x-small">SOME BRIEF GROUNDS, SERVING TO PROVE THAT THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE YET
IN FULL FORCE, AND SHALL SO REMAIN TILL HEAVEN AND EARTH PASS AWAY.</p>

</div>

<p>1. The matter of the ten commandments was written
in the heart of Adam before his fall, as doth appear
in Gen. 1:27, <i>God created man in his own image,
in the image of God created he him</i>; also in Eccl. 7:29,
<i>God hath made man upright, but they have sought
out many inventions</i>. And the Apostle plainly asserts,
that the gentiles, which had not the law, (in the letter
of it,) did by nature the things contained in the law,
which showeth the work of the law written in their
hearts. Rom. 2:14, 15. Now if the gentiles had
the word of the law written in their hearts in their
sinful state, doubtless they had it in more perfection
in their state of innocence, as considered in Adam;
for the letter of the law was added because of transgression.
Gal. 2:19. Now if there was transgression
before the letter of the law was added, that
implies that there was a law before then; in that the
letter of the law is said to be added, it implies that
the matter of it was in being before, but much worn
by sin; and that is one reason why the Lord was
pleased to add the letter.</p>

<p>Let it be considered, how it can stand with Scripture
or right reason, that Jesus Christ should abrogate
this law. Did Christ blot out this law from the
hearts of all men by his death? Then all men have
not the law of nature to guide them; for we cannot
be so gross as to imagine that the law is put into
their hearts upon a new account, for that were to
bring all men under the new covenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-8}</span>
2. God spake all these commandments unto the
people, and they heard his voice, (Deut. 5:22-24,)
with great majesty and glory, and he added no
more; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone,
and delivered them unto Moses&mdash;all of which holds
forth their perpetuity; they are spoken by God, they
are written by him in tables of stone; so was
never any ceremony. Job desired that his words
might be graven with a pen of iron and lead in a
rock of stone forever. Job 19:24.</p>

<p>3. Afterward the first tables were broken, which I
suppose did signify the Israelites' breaking of the
first covenant; for Moses broke them on account of
their having made a golden calf, and so had broken
the covenant. Whereupon Moses was then commanded
to hew two tables like the first, and God
wrote the same words again upon them, (Deut. 10:1-4,)
and they only of all the laws were put into
the ark, and when the ark is set in its proper place
between the cherubim there is nothing in it but the
two tables. 1&nbsp;Kings 8:9. Now the ark was a
type of Christ, and the putting of the law into it did
signify the putting of it into the heart of Christ,
(Psalm 40:6-8, <i>Thy law is in my heart</i>,) and from
thence they are transcribed into the hearts of the
seed of Christ. See Jer. 31:33, where God
promises to put his law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts. Now what law is
this that must be put into the heart, when the law
of sacrifice is abolished? Compare Heb. 10:6-9,
with the fore-mentioned Psalm. That this is the
law that is here spoken of is manifest if we consider
how proper and suitable it is for the heart of a
believer. Paul calls it the law of his mind in Rom.
7:23, and in verse 22 he professeth he delights in
the law of God after the inward man; and God
saith he will put the law in his heart and write it
<span class="pagenum">{16-9}</span>
there; both which phrases hold it forth to be the
same law that was written by God and put into the
ark. Man's heart is the tables, and God himself is
the writer; the matter written is the law. Hear
what Wisdom saith to this: <i>My son, keep my words,
and lay up my commandments within thee; keep my
commandments and live, and my law as the apple of
thine eye; bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon
the table of thy heart</i>. Prov. 7:1-3. Now what
laws are these but the table laws? And Wisdom's
son is to have them written upon the fleshy tables
of his heart.</p>

<p>4. When God promiseth to exalt his first-born
higher than the kings of the earth, and that his covenant
should stand fast with him, and that his seed
should endure forever, and his throne as the days of
heaven, (Psalms 89:28, 29,) yet he saith, <i>If his
children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
if they break my statutes, and keep not my
commandments; then will I visit their transgression
with a rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless,
my loving kindness will I not utterly take away,
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</i> Verses 30-32.
Mark it, this covenant was with Christ, (though with
David in the type,) in behalf of all the seed; and
the chastisements must be the portion of the seed
if they break the law of God, though his covenant
stand fast. Now as this covenant reaches all the
seed, so doth the law and the punishments for the
breach of it; and if so, then what law is it that
reaches all the seed, if not the law of the ten commandments,
with those laws which are comprehended
in them.</p>

<p>5. These commandments are eminently distinguished
and marked out from all the ceremonial
laws, both to show their eminency and perpetuity:
they are said to be the work of God, in Exod. 32:16;
<span class="pagenum">{16-10}</span>
and the Psalmist saith, <i>The works of his hands
are verity and judgment</i>. And these works are
called, <i>all his commandments</i>, in Psalm 111:7, and
they are ten. Deut. 4:13. And therefore I conceive
Wisdom's son is to bind them upon his fingers,
to show the number of them, there being for each
finger one, and that both hands might be active in
them. And Zacharias and Elisabeth were said to
walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord. Luke 1:6. They are distinguished from
the ceremonial ordinances, and called all the commandments,
to set forth their number, as before said,
and their eminencey; and therefore they are so frequently
called in the Scripture, <i>the commandments
of God</i>, distinct from the other laws, which were
shadowy in the time of the law of shadows, (as
these places of Scripture, besides many others, do
show, viz., Deut. 5:31, 6:11, 7:11, 8:11, 11:1,
30:16, 1&nbsp;Kings 2:3, 8:58, 2&nbsp;Chron. 19:10, Neh.
1:7, and 10:29, &amp;c.,) and distinct from the testimony
of Jesus in clear gospel times. In Rev. 12:17,
note that the dragon's war is with the remnant
of the woman's seed which kept the commandments
of God and the testimony of Jesus.
And again, here are they that keep the commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus. Rev. 14:12.
And when the man would know what he should do
to be saved, Christ told him that he knew the commandments.
A cloud of witnesses would come in,
if need were, for the confirmation of them. But
farther observe what the Scripture saith to their duration.
The Psalmist saith, <i>All his commandments
are sure, they stand fast for ever and ever, and are
done in truth and uprightness</i>. Psalm 111:7, 8.
Note it; all his commandments, which are the
works of his hands, as aforesaid, stand fast for ever
and ever; that is, not only in the time of the ministration
<span class="pagenum">{16-11}</span>
of the letter, which was in a sense for ever,
but for ever and ever, that is, under both ministrations,
that of the letter and that of the spirit, in
Old Testament times and in the New. Search and
see if you can find any word that doth speak of any
thing that is said to abide or stand fast for ever and
ever, which comes short of the time aforesaid. And
when God hides his face from the house of Jacob,
then is the time that the testimony is bound up and
the law is sealed among the disciples, (Isa. 8:16,
17,) clearly relating to the time that the Jews rejected
the gospel, and the disciples are commanded
to make use of the law as well as the testimony to
try the doctrines of others by. Isa. 8:20. All
which shows the perpetuity of this law of God,
which will farther appear if we consider Deut. 7:9.
Our Lord saith in Matt. 5:17, 18, <i>Think not that
I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I came
not to destroy, but to fulfill</i>. But the question will be,
what law this is? To me it appears to be the law
of the ten commandments; for these reasons:</p>

<p>1st. Because this comes in as the motive to provoke
his disciples to let their light shine in the
world, that men might see their good works and
glorify their Father which is in heaven. Matt 5:16.
Therefore it must be such a law as the doing
of it holds forth good works to public view.</p>

<p>2d. It is such a law as Christ professes he came
not to destroy; but the ceremonial law he destroyed
in this very sense, so that none are to be in the practice
of it; he blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances
that was against us, and contrary to us,
and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.</p>

<p>3d. Destroying of the law is here put in direct
opposition to fulfilling of it; to destroy is to take
out of the way or to blot out as before; but to fulfill
the law is to do that which is contained in the
<span class="pagenum">{16-12}</span>
law; therefore saith Christ to John, when he went
to be baptized, <i>It becometh us to fulfill all righteousness</i>,
(that is, to perform it.) Matt. 3:15. And the
Apostle saith, that love is the fulfilling of the law.
What law? Why this, <i>Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, &amp;c. Love
worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law.</i> Rom. 13:8-10. So that, to
fulfill the law of the ten commandments, is not to
blot them out or make them void; that were to destroy
them, which Christ came not to do, but, on
the contrary, to do the things contained in them,
which he did exactly in his life, and so was offered
up a Lamb without spot.</p>

<p>4th. This is such a law as must stand in force,
every jot and tittle of it, till heaven and earth pass
away. Matt. 5:19. But heaven and earth are not
yet passed away; therefore this law stands firm.
But because it is said in the text, Till all be fulfilled,
hence some affirm that all was fulfilled at the death
of Christ, and this fulfilling of it holds forth the abrogating
of it. But did heaven and earth pass away
then? or did Christ, by his taking upon him all that
guilt which was due to us, and by his perfect fulfilling
of it in his walk, take us from our obedience?
God forbid. Because Christ fulfilled the righteousness
of the law, must we not fulfill it? The Apostle
saith that for this end Christ died. <i>For what the law
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
sin condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of
the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the
flesh but after the spirit.</i> Rom. 8:3, 4. But what is
the fulfilling of the righteousness of the law, but to do
the righteous things contained in the law? And in this
sense every true believer doth fulfill the law, though his
completeness be in Christ; for love is the fulfilling of
<span class="pagenum">{16-13}</span>
the law, (Rom. 13:10,) so that the commanding
power of the law is such a just measure, that every
one that loves acts his part towards the fulfilling of it.</p>

<p>5th. It farther appears to be the ten commandments,
by the use Christ makes of what he had before
asserted: <i>Whosoever therefore shall break one
of these least commandments, and shall teach men so,
shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven</i>. Matt.
5:19. That is, forasmuch as that law must stand
till heaven and earth pass away, and I came not to
destroy it, therefore beware of breaking it, for whosoever
you are that break any part of it, and shall
teach men so, you shall be called the least in the
kingdom of heaven; <i>but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom
of heaven</i>. To prevent farther mistake, he repeateth
the law in many particulars, and gives the sense,
showing how far their righteousness should exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees. By
all of which it plainly appears, that this law, which
Christ came not to destroy, is the law of the ten
commandments, or the laws that were comprehended
in them.</p>

<p>6. The Apostle confirmeth and establisheth this
law after the death of Christ, as plainly appears in
the third chapter of Romans, the drift of which
is to set Jews and Gentiles in a like condition by
nature&mdash;all breakers of the law of God, and so become
guilty before him, (verse 19,) and that therefore
no flesh could be justified by the deeds of the
law, the law being for another purpose&mdash;to convince
of sin, (verse 20,) or to bring sin to their knowledge.
He proves that Jews and Gentiles, circumcised and
uncircumcised, are justified by and through faith,
and not by the law of works. Verses 27-30. But
lest the Gentiles should think, because they could
not be justified by the works of the law, that therefore
<span class="pagenum">{16-14}</span>
they might look upon the law as a thing done
away or made void, he puts this question to the uncircumcised
Gentiles, <i>Do we then make void the law
through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the
law.</i> He settles this question, whether the law be in
force to believing Gentiles or no, with a God forbid;
which shows the greatness of his zeal against
such a persuasion, it being the same answer which
he gives to another gross question, whether we
should continue in sin that grace might abound;
and, as if that were not enough, he adds to it, Yea,
we establish the law.</p>

<p>7. This same Apostle doth prove that the law
was in force at the time of his conversion. He
saith he had not known sin but by the law; he had
not known lust except the law had said, <i>Thou shalt
not covet</i>. Rom. 7:7. He was alive without the
law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived,
and he died, (verse 9,) that is, not without
the letter of it, for that he had, and did in a great
measure conform to, but without powerful convictions
for sin by the law; and in this sense then
the commandment came, sin revived, and he died
that before was alive in his own apprehension.
<i>For without the law sin was dead</i>, (verse 8,) and by
the law is the knowledge of sin; and sin, taking occasion
by the commandment, deceived him, and slew
him. <i>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment
is holy, just and good</i>, (verses 11, 12;) not that
the holy and just law was made death unto him&mdash;God
forbid&mdash;but sin, that it might appear sin, by
this good law wrought death in him, that by the
commandment sin might appear exceeding sinful.
Verse 13. And if so, then this law did not die with
the body of Christ; though we are dead to the law
by the body of Christ, that we should serve in newness
of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter,
<span class="pagenum">{16-15}</span>
and that we should be married to another, even him
who is raised from the dead; we being dead to that
spirit of bondage in which we were held, that we
set our obedience to the law no longer in the room
of Christ as our head and husband; Christ by his
blood having purchased us from that power that the
law had over us by reason of sin. So that our service
is not to satisfy the law, as a woman serves to
please her husband that she is bound to; but we
are not dead to serving in newness of spirit in obedience
to Christ as our husband. Rom. 7:4-6. In
this sense the Apostle delights in the law of God
after the inward man, (verse 22,) though the other
law in his members stood in great opposition to it.
Verse 23. Mind this chapter well, and it will appear
so plain that he that runs may read, that the
Apostle intends no such thing as to take us from our
obedience to the law, nor yet the abrogating of the
law, but the contrary.</p>

<p>8. The same Apostle urges the law, in the very
letter of it, to the Ephesians. He saith, in chapter
6:1-3, <i>Children, obey your parents, for this is right;
honor thy father and thy mother, which is the first
commandment with promise.</i> He proves his exhortation
to be right from the commandment, and he
takes notice of the order of the commandments;
it is the first commandment of that second table,
and it hath a promise annexed to it. He speaks in
the present tense; he does not say it <i>was</i> the first
commandment, but it <i>is</i> the first with a promise,
<i>that thy days may be long on the earth</i>. He urges the
promise to them for their encouragement; and to
prevent mistakes, he shows the extent of it, that it
was not only to the Jews, that they should live long
in the land of Canaan, but to the Gentiles also;
therefore the interpretation says, <i>that thy days may
be long on the earth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-16}</span>
9. James gives a full confirmation to what I am
treating of. He convinces them of sin by this law,
in having the faith of Jesus Christ with respect of
persons, as appears by chapter 2:10, 11, <i>For whosoever
shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.</i> He shows what law he
means, and how it is that he who offends in one
point is guilty of all; because, <i>He that saith, Do not
commit adultery, saith also, Do not kill; now if thou
commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become
a transgressor of the law.</i> And John saith, <i>Whosoever
committeth sin transgresseth the law, for sin is
the transgression of the law,</i> (1&nbsp;John 3:3, 4;) and in
the next verse he explains what law he means, and
saith, it was such transgression that Christ was manifested
to take away. Now if this law of God was
done away by the death of Christ, sin could not be
a transgression of it so long after; neither could
any be convinced of sin by it, because it was not.
But the Apostle saith, <i>Whosoever commiteth sin transgresseth
the law;</i> which shows it was in force then,
and not only so, but that likewise it should so remain.</p>

<p>10. Let it be considered whether this opinion
that the law is done away doth not clash with redemption
itself. The Apostle states that all men
were under the law, and by breaking of it they came
under the curse. Gal. 3:10. And Christ was made
under the curse, to redeem his people from under
the curse of the law, that the blessing of Abraham
might come upon the Gentiles through faith. Verses
13, 14. Now if we were not under the commanding
power, we could not be under the curse, (for
that follows disobedience,) and if so, then Christ
was not made a curse for us; neither can the blessing
of Abraham come upon the Gentiles upon that
account, if the Jews only were under the law, and
<span class="pagenum">{16-17}</span>
under the curse of it. Christ's dying to redeem them
from the curse, could not bring the blessing of
Abraham upon the Gentiles. And again, the Apostle
saith, <i>that Christ was made under the law, to redeem
them that were under the law, that we might receive
the adoption of sons</i>. Gal. 4:4, 5. Now if we
were not under the law, we could not be redeemed
by Christ's being under the law, nor receive the
adoption of sons thereby; but it is manifest that
every one is under the commanding power of the
law, and by nature under the curse; and Christ
hath only redeemed his people from the curse, but
they are not redeemed from their obedience to the
law of God. I find no Scripture that saith so; but
the contrary.</p>

<p>11. God complaineth of the blindness of his servants,
and of the deafness of his messengers that he
sent, (Isa. 42:19, 20,) and their blindness and deafness
appears in this, that they did not hear nor understand
God's design in the gift of his Son, that
it was not to destroy the law or to slight it, but to magnify
it and make it honorable. Verse 2. Previously
it was in tables of stone, but now in the fleshy tables
of the heart; service was then done from a spirit
of bondage, but now from a spirit of adoption. And
in this sense I conceive the law to be magnified and
made honorable, and upon this account God is
well pleased for his righteousness' sake, that is, I
conceive, for his Son's sake.</p>

<p>12. This opinion, that the whole law is abolished,
doth pull up true magistracy by the roots, the office
of rulers being for the punishment of evil doers,
and for the praise of them that do well. But if the
statutes and judgments be not in force, there is no
corporeal punishment to be inflicted upon any,
though thieves, murderers, or the like; and so there
is no room for the magisterial power at all, but men
<span class="pagenum">{16-18}</span>
are left in this respect as the beasts of the field, to
shift one among another as well as they can. But
the Apostle saith, <i>The law is made for the lawless
and disobedient, for ungodly and for sinners, for unholy
and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers
of mothers, for man-slayers</i>, &amp;c. 1&nbsp;Tim. 1:9,
10. Now that this is the law of penalties, is manifest,
in that it is said it was not made for a righteous
man; but the ten commandments were for the
righteous, for the Psalmist saith, <i>Make me to go in
the path of thy commandments, for therein do I delight.
O how love I thy law! It is my meditation all
the day.</i> Psalm 119:35, 97.</p>

<p>And how shall we have governors as at the first,
and counsellors as at the beginning, (Isa. 1:26,)
if they have no law to govern by? If any say we
shall have laws from Christ, and shall not need those
laws that were for the commonwealth of Israel, I
answer, I know no word of God that doth give us
ground to hope for any other laws of Scripture
then what we have. And suppose that God should
revive his work and bring his enemies under, and
put opportunity into the hands of men fearing God
and hating covetousness to rule the nation, and to
make laws according to Scripture, what could
they do if the Scripture were not their statute-book,
if they should turn law-makers? Would not that be
their sin, there being no warrant in the Scripture
for it? And would it not bring all into confusion
again, and make another Babel? For the great
question which is to be resolved in the latter days,
will be, Who is our statute-maker?&mdash;which the
saints put out of question in Isa. 33:22, <i>The Lord
is our Judge, the Lord is our Statute-maker, the Lord
is our King, he will save us,</i> (and not king Omri with
his statutes.) Mich. 6:16. And when the saints
come to own this truth in good earnest, their opponents'
<span class="pagenum">{16-19}</span>
tacklings will be loosed; they shall neither
strengthen their masts, nor spread their sails. And
Malachi tells us what laws our King hath made,
which the saints are to own when the day of the
Lord shall burn as an oven all the proud, and the
Sun of Righteousness arise upon all that fear him;
when they shall tread down the wicked with so much
ease that they shall be as ashes under the soles of
their feet, so that it shall be counted the Lord's
doings. And in the day that the Lord shall do this,
<i>Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I
commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the
statutes and judgments.</i> Mal. 4:3, 4.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I shall now endeavor to answer some objections
which are usually brought against this truth, though
several of them are partly answered in the grounds
before mentioned. I shall therefore say the less, and
begin to speak something to that Scripture in 2&nbsp;Corinthians,
third chapter, on which the objectors chiefly
build their persuasion; and indeed at the first glance
thereon, without comparing it with other Scriptures,
it hath more color for such a purpose than all
the Scriptures that ever I heard brought; from
which Scripture this is objected, that the ten commandments
were the ministration of death and the
letter, and are done away.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> That they were the ministration of death
and of the letter is granted, for the Scripture saith
so; but the Scripture doth not say that they are
done away, as will appear, if we consider the drift
of the Apostle. He endeavoreth to show the difference
between the ministration of the spirit and of
the letter, the one being a bare reading of the law,
from which no life was communicated to those that
heard it. The Apostle calls it the ministration of
<span class="pagenum">{16-20}</span>
condemnation, that is, it lays open sin, and the curse
for sin, but it is the gospel ministration which holds
forth justification and strength against sin; not that
the ten commandments in themselves were death to
any&mdash;God forbid! as the Apostle saith in Rom. 7:13;
but sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death;
and the commandments preach death to the transgressors
of them, so that they are called the ministration
of death and condemnation, because man
hath broken them, and so is under the curse of them,
which Christ hath delivered believers from, (Rom.
3:13;) and the ministration of it is really done
away, that is, as I said before, the reading of the
law by a typical priesthood, which the Jews would
have set up in the room and place of the ministration
of the spirit. And whereas they lived under the
hearing of the bare letter of the law, which gave
no strength to perform, we live under the hearing
of the gospel, which is spirit and life. John 6:36.
But that the matter of the law, or commanding
power of it, should be done away, this Scripture
doth not in the least prove, but it is used in the
hand of the Spirit to convince of sin. This the
same Apostle proves in Rom. 7:7, where he saith,
<i>I had not known sin but by the law; I had not known
lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</i>
This will appear evident if we consider the same
chapter from verse 8 to verse 14.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> 2. Another Scripture is frequently urged
from Acts 7:37&mdash;<i>A prophet shall the Lord your
God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me;
him shall ye hear.</i> From which it is concluded, that
we are to hearken only to Christ and not to Moses.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> If by hearing of Christ you mean hearing
only what he spake with his own lips when he
was on earth, then we are not to hear his apostles.
<span class="pagenum">{16-21}</span>
But if you mean, by hearing of him, to hear
what he spake upon earth and what he spake by his
Spirit in his apostles, then why are we not to hear
what he spake by his Spirit to his prophets, seeing
we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ being the chief corner-stone. Eph.
21:20. And if those who are of this persuasion
would be true to their principle to hear Christ, hear
him what he saith in Luke 16:31&mdash;<i>They have Moses
and the prophets, let them hear them; for if they will
not believe Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</i> And he
counsels to keep the commandments, (Matt. 19:17,
18,) and reproves for the breach of them, as also
for the making them void by traditions, (Matt. 15:6,)
as might be made to appear by many other
Scriptures. Therefore there is nothing of weight
in this objection to shake the thing asserted. But
for a more full answer to this objection and the
former, I must needs entreat the reader to see my
other book on the Sabbath.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> 3. Moses was faithful over his house as
a servant, so Christ is faithful over his house as a
son. Now, if Christ hath not given us all the laws
that we are to observe, this is to make Christ less
faithful than Moses.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Doubtless Christ as a son is faithful over
his house, as Moses was faithful over his house as a
servant. But we are to consider, what was Moses'
house, and what is Christ's house. Moses' house,
I conceive, was the Tabernacle; his faithfulness did
appear in that he did all things according to the
pattern showed him in the Mount. Christ's house
is the saints, the true tabernacle which the Lord
hath pitched and not man, (Heb. 8:2, 5,) of which
the other was a shadow. And as Moses as a servant
<span class="pagenum">{16-22}</span>
gave forth ordinances for his house, so Christ as a
son has given out ordinances for his house. But
the ten commandments are a law which belongs to
men as they are men, though they be no part of
Christ's house, it being, as before proved, the law
written in their very hearts.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> 4. But when certain of the sect of the pharisees
arose and said it was needful to be circumcised
and keep the law of Moses, the Apostle proves them
to be tempters of God, in putting a yoke upon the
neck of the disciples, which neither they nor their
fathers were able to bear. Acts 15:5, 10.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Are the ten commandments such a yoke as
is not to be borne? Is it a yoke to have no other
God but Jehovah, and to abstain from murder,
theft, adultery, and the like? For so it must be, if
you judge that the whole law is here slighted. But
the thing under discussion here is, whether such and
such laws are to be kept or not, and the stress that
is laid upon the keeping of them, namely, the pressing
of them as things without which they could not
be saved, as in Acts 15:1; and therefore the
Apostle, in answer to this, shows that the Gentiles
had received the gospel and did believe, God having
given to them the Holy Ghost, and put no difference
between them and the Jews, purifying their
hearts by faith, (verses 7-9,) and that through the
grace of Jesus Christ both Jews and Gentiles should
be saved, (verse 11;) and as the Apostle opposeth
the keeping of these laws for such a purpose as to
be saved thereby, so the bare keeping of them is
forbidden. And therefore James saith, (verses 19,
20,) <i>My sentence is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles are turned unto God, but that
we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions
of idols, from fornication, from things strangled, and
<span class="pagenum">{16-23}</span>
from blood.</i> So that the Apostle's judgment is, that
the Gentiles should keep some part of the law.
And therefore the question was not, whether any
part of the law should be kept; and the reason why
they would write no more seems to be in verse 20,
<i>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that
preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath
day.</i> So the apostles and elders write, in verse
24, <i>Forasmuch as we have heard that certain men that
went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting
your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised and
keep the law, to whom we gave no such commandment.</i>
Now can we be so gross as to think, that it is subverting
men's souls, and contrary to the commandments
of the apostles and elders, to bid them love the Lord
their God with all their hearts and with all their
strength, and to worship him alone, and not to take
his name in vain, and the like? This is to keep
the law. But the difference was about other laws
as well as circumcision, and they are as really forbidden
to keep them, as they are forbidden circumcision;
and therefore it cannot be the law of the
ten commandments, but the law of shadows, as is
manifest by chapter 21. When Paul came to Jerusalem,
the brethren told him that it was reported
that he taught all the Jews which were among the
Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying, <i>that they ought
not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after
the customs</i>, (verse 21;) therefore they counseled Paul
to purify himself, with some others, that it might be
seen that he walked orderly and kept the law.
Verse 24. <i>But as touching the Gentiles which believe,
we have written and concluded that they observe no
such things.</i> Verse 25. So that it is very clear, that
it is circumcision and the customs that is here called
the law of Moses, which the Gentiles were commanded
not to keep. But to think that the Gentiles
<span class="pagenum">{16-24}</span>
should be forbidden to keep the law of God that was
written in their natures is abominable, and contrary
both to Scripture and reason.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> 5. But the Scripture saith, <i>Cast out the
bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman
shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman</i>;
which bond-woman was an allegory of the covenant
from Mount Sinai, and therefore to be cast out.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The Apostle is here showing how impossible
it is for works and grace to stand together
in point of justification; for this people were seeking
to be justified by the works of the law. He
shows the difference betwixt the two covenants, one
of works gendering to bondage, <i>the righteousness of
the law being this, that the man that doeth these things
should live in them</i>, (Rom. 10:5;) the other of grace
or free promise, without any respect to man's righteousness.
He shows that the sons of the covenants
are like unto their mothers; the sons of the one covenant
are born after the flesh, the sons of the other
by promise; and those that are born after the flesh
persecute those that are born after the Spirit.
Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? <i>Cast out
the bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman
shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman;</i>
that is, the covenant of works with those
that seek to be justified thereby, <i>Christ being the
end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth</i>.
Rom. 10:4. But if we should understand
the ten commandments in themselves to be the
bond-woman, then it is impossible for them that
keep them to be heirs or children of the promise,
but they must be cast out as children of the bond-woman,
which is very erroneous, and contrary to
the current of the Scriptures. For the doers of the
law are justified before God, (Rom. 2:13,) though
<span class="pagenum">{16-25}</span>
not for doing. And mark how the Apostle forbids
this notion in Romans 3:31&mdash;<i>Do we then make void
the law through faith? God forbid! Shall we continue
in sin,</i> or transgress the law, <i>that grace may
abound? God forbid!</i> Rom. 6:1, 2. <i>Is the law
sin? God forbid!</i> Rom. 7:7. <i>Was the law,
which was good, made death unto me? God forbid!</i>
Verse 13. <i>Shall we transgress the law because we
are not under the condemning power of it,</i> (Christ
having redeemed us from it?) <i>God forbid!</i> Rom.
6:15. Certainly the Scripture did foresee how
apt men would be to slight and make void the law
of God under specious pretences, as their being believers,
and Gentiles which had not the law given
to them, but that they are under grace, and the
like. <i>If the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of
the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</i>
Rom. 2:26.</p>

<p>Consider these queries&mdash;1. If the whole law was
done away by the death of Christ, why did the
Apostle spend so much time to prove that by the
works of the law none could be justified, (Gal. 3,)
seeing there was no law to work upon? Would
it not have been a nearer way to have told them
that the law was abolished?</p>

<p>2. If the whole law was done away at the death
of Christ, how can any part of it be now in force?
If it be said it is upon a new account, show me any
one law that Christ hath once destroyed and again
revived, seeing the Apostle saith, if he should build
again the things that he destroyed, he should make
himself a transgressor. Gal. 2:14.</p>

<p>3. What Scripture proves that we have any one of
the ten commandments given out on a new account?</p>

<p>4. If the whole law be done away, what law is
there for the punishment of evil-doers, thieves, murderers,
and the like?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-26}</span>
5. If the ten commandments are to be abolished,
how is it that the Lord hath annexed so many great
and precious promises to the keeping of them and
delighting in them, as in Psalms 1:1-4, and many
other places, which do of right belong to such as
keep the commandments? Rev. 22:14.</p>

<p>6. How is it that the Apostle saith, the law is
good if a man use it lawfully, (1&nbsp;Tim. 1:8,) if at
the same time there be no law?</p>

<p>7. If the law was done away at the death of
Christ, when was it given again upon a new account?
If it was given before his death, (in the 5th chapter
of Matthew,) then how is it that the law that was
given on Sinai stood in force till that time? Could
they both stand in force at once? If not till after
the death of Christ, then when was it given out,
seeing that we find not any of the commandments
so much as mentioned for a long time after the
death of Christ? Can we think the saints and the
world were left without a law?</p>

<p>8. How is it that we contend for governors as at
the first, and counsellors as at the beginning, seeing
there is no law for them to rule and govern by, if this
doctrine be true, that the whole law is done away?</p>

<p>Thus I have endeavored in a measure to prove,
that the ten commandments are not only in force to
unbelievers, but also to believers. But believers
are not under the law so as to be justified or condemned
by it; not under it as a covenant of works
and ministration of death, but under it as a righteous
rule of life&mdash;a holy, just, and good law; so they
are under it, and do delight in it. Rom. 7:22;
Psalms 119:70, 72, 97; 1&nbsp;Cor. 9:21. <i>It is time
for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy
law,</i> (Psalms 119:122.) <i>Therefore I esteem all thy
precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate
every false way,</i> (Verse 128.)</p>

<h3>THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH.</h3>

</div>

<p>If the ten commandments be in force, every jot
and tittle of them, it must necessarily follow that
the seventh day is the Sabbath, and is to be observed
according to the commandment. But because
there is much opposition against this truth, I shall
offer something in particular to it, which may tend
to the clearing of it.</p>

<p>1. It was instituted by God before the fall of man,
as appears in Gen. 1:31&mdash;<i>And God saw every thing
that he had made, and behold it was very good.</i> But
when man sinned, God changed his voice, and then
the ground was cursed for his sake. Gen. 3:17.
Farther, God was six days upon his work of creation,
and rested not until the seventh day. Now,
betwixt the end of the sixth day and the beginning
of the seventh day, there is no interval or space of
time, (chap. 1:31, 2:2;) then why should it be
thought that the Sabbath was a shadow to hold
forth rest by faith, and why should we run into such
imaginations concerning the cause of God's instituting
the Sabbath, seeing God so plainly declared
it himself, namely, <i>that he blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it, because that in it he rested, from all his
works which God created and made</i>. Gen. 2:3.</p>

<p>2. The reason that the Lord gave when he commanded
the observance of the seventh day, was as
before, <i>because that in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested
the seventh day, wherefore the Lord, blessed the Sabbath
day and hallowed it</i>, (Exod. 20:11;) and it is
as a motive to provoke man to follow the Lord's example
from the beginning, both in work and rest.
<span class="pagenum">{16-28}</span>
<i>Six days,</i> saith the Lord, <i>thou shalt labor and do all
thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God; in it thou shalt do no manner of work.</i>
And if thou wouldest know a reason why thou
shouldest do so, it is because I the Lord thy God
did so. And truly, to me it is clear, that one main
reason why the Lord took so much time as six days
to create all things in, and rested the seventh day,
was to show man an example, and what he ought
to do. Doubtless God could have made all things
in a moment; but six days he works, and rests the
seventh day, that man might do the same, and thereby
not only hold forth the creating power of God,
and the method that he was pleased to take in the
creation, but also his great mercy in instructing and
commanding man to work six days and rest the
seventh, that he might be refreshed.</p>

<p>3. It plainly appears, that this institution was in
force and to be observed from the beginning, though
no mention is made of the patriarchs observing it,
no more than of their sacrificing and doing many
other things, which it is judged that they did, notwithstanding
we hear nothing of them. But consider,
God rested the seventh day and sanctified it.
Now to profane that which God sanctifies doubtless
is a sin; and had they done servile work upon the
Sabbath, they had profaned it. Neh. 13:16, 17.
And what the Lord said to Peter, in another case,
may be rightly said in this, namely, <i>What God hath
sanctified, that call not thou common or unclean.</i> Acts
10:15. And the Lord, when he gave forth this
command, saith, <i>Remember the Sabbath</i>, to note the
importance of it, and the antiquity of it, it being no
new thing, but from the beginning; and that the
Lord urges, in verse 11, as the cause why it was to
be observed. Israel observed the Sabbath before
the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, as appears in
<span class="pagenum">{16-29}</span>
Exod. 16:23, 25, 26. But mark what Nehemiah
saith to this in, chapter 9:13, 14, <i>Thou camest down
also upon Mount Sinai, and spakest with them from
heaven, and gavest them right judgments and true
laws, good statutes and commandments, and madest
known also unto them thy holy Sabbath.</i> Mark, this
commandment is singled out from all the rest, and
is said to be made known to them, which shows that
it was in being before, though probably they might
lose the observation of it, by reason of their hard
bondage in Egypt. However, it is plain that they
had need of the knowledge of the Sabbath, and
God makes it known unto them. And Christ leads us
plainly to the first institution of it when he saith,
<i>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath.</i> He points to the making of it, and for
whom it was made, not for the Jews only as Jews,
but for man, before there was any such distinction
as Jew and Gentile; and in that it was made for
man, which was the public person or representative
of the whole of mankind, it was made for all men,
Adam standing as a public person before his fall.</p>

<p>4. Our Lord Jesus doth show the true end of
God's giving the Sabbath, and also how it ought to
be kept, and shows the pharisees their mistake in
the observation of it, they being so rigid that they
would not suffer good works and works of mercy
to be done, though there were necessity for the doing
of them, as will appear if we consider the following
Scriptures: The pharisees asked Christ if it
was lawful to heal on the Sabbath day, that they
might accuse him, (Matt. 12:10,) and his answer
was this, <i>What man is there among you that shall have
one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day,
will he not lay hold on it and lift it out? How much
then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.</i> Matt. 12:10-12.
<span class="pagenum">{16-30}</span>
Again, the pharisees told Christ that his
disciples did that which was not lawful, because
they pulled the ears of corn upon the Sabbath day.
But mind the answer of Christ, <i>Have ye not read
what David did when he was a hungered and had
need, how he entered into the house of God, and did
eat the shew-bread, which it is not lawful for any to
eat but the priests?</i> Mark 2:24-26. <i>Have ye not
read in the law, that the priests in the temple profane
the Sabbath day and are blameless?</i> Matt. 12:5.
It was not unlawful to pluck the ears of corn when
they went through their neighbor's field, for that
they might do by the law of God, (Deut. 23:25,)
and that the pharisees knew very well; but they
thought it was unlawful because they did it upon
the Sabbath day. But mark the answer of Christ,
how he cleared the disciples; it was unlawful for
David to eat the shew-bread, but he was a hungered
and had need, and therefore to be excused. If
the disciples had pulled the ears of corn when they
had no need, upon the Sabbath day, it had been doing
of needless work, and so had been unlawful.
But the text saith they were a hungered, therefore
they might do it, it being a work of mercy as David's
was. And the same may be said of the priests' profaning
the Sabbath, who, notwithstanding, are said
to be blameless. Their preparation of the sacrifices
was allowed, which work in itself would have been
counted servile work, but that it was for such a
merciful end, namely, the sins of the people; therefore
saith Christ, <i>Had ye known what this meaneth, I
will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have
condemned the guiltless.</i> Matt. 12:7. Clearly proving
that the Sabbath was to be observed, (but not so as
to break another command, to neglect mercy, which
the pharisees would do,) and that his disciples, in having
mercy on their bodies, were no Sabbath-breakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-31}</span>
Farther, observe what Christ saith in Mark 2:27,
<i>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath.</i> The pharisees made themselves slaves and
bond-men by making the Sabbath a yoke, (whereas
it should have been a delight, Isa. 58:13,) by superstitious
outside performances, as though man had
been made for the Sabbath. But Christ tells them,
it was made for man, that is, for the good and benefit
of man, that he might rest from his labors and be
refreshed, as they were in Exod. 31:17. And thus
you see how clearly our Lord hath given the sense
of this law. It is lawful to do well upon the Sabbath
day, to visit the sick and to heal them, and to
do works of mercy to our own and others' bodies,
the Sabbath being made for man.</p>

<p>5. Jesus Christ declares himself to be Lord even
of the Sabbath day, (Matt. 12:8,) and he takes his
title thus: <i>The Sabbath,</i> saith he, <i>was made for man,
and not man for the Sabbath; therefore the Son of
Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.</i> Here seems
to be two things from whence Christ takes this title.
First, the Sabbath was made for man, that is, as before
was said, for Adam, and so for all men, being
made for him before his fall. Now, Christ being
the Son of Man, the chief man, or second Adam,
the man of God's right hand, the heir of all things,
is of right Lord even of the Sabbath day. Second,
the Sabbath was made for man, that is, for the good
of man, and in mercy to man, as is said before.
Therefore, Christ being the author of all good, the
giver of all mercy, he is Lord of it; and, therefore,
Christ doth not slight the Sabbath (as some do imagine)
by saying he is Lord of it, as though he
were not to keep it, or that his intent was to change
it. That were to strip himself of his title, or else
to entitle himself Lord of that which was not. But
in that it is said Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, it
<span class="pagenum">{16-32}</span>
proves the Sabbath to be in force. As Christ proves
the resurrection, in Mark 12:26, 27&mdash;<i>I am the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob; I
am not the God of the dead, but of the living</i>&mdash;so
Christ is Lord of the Sabbath day. He is not Lord
of the dead types and shadows, or of that which
is not in being, but he is Lord of the lively
oracles, of which I consider the Sabbath to be one.
Acts 7:38.</p>

<p><i>Objection.</i> But did not Christ break the Sabbath,
and teach men so to do, in bidding the impotent
man take up his bed and walk, it being unlawful to
carry a burden upon the Sabbath day?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The scribes and pharisees said so, indeed,
and that his bed was a burden; but they
were very unfit judges, they being ignorant of the
right manner of observing the Sabbath, and seeking
likewise to take advantage against Christ in his
words and actions. Their saying the man's bed was
a burden, and that it was unlawful for him to carry
it, doth prove no more that was it so, than their saying
that the disciples did break the Sabbath in plucking
the ears of corn, and Christ in healing the diseased.
But was not this a work of mercy, the man
having been lame so long in the porch now being
cured? Was it not meet that he should be released
from the place, and take his bed with him to lay on
at night? (for it is likely he had no other.) And who
can say that it was a burden? In some countries
that which they call a bed is no heavier than a good
cloak or coat. But consider what gross wickedness
naturally flows from this opinion. The objectors
themselves, and all, must acknowledge that the
whole law was in force till the death of Christ&mdash;the
very shadows, till he nailed them to his cross; then
the fourth commandment doubtless was in force.
<span class="pagenum">{16-33}</span>
Now, to say that Christ broke it, and taught men so,
is to say that Christ sinned, and taught men to sin,
(for sin is the transgression of the law,) and this roots
up redemption by Christ; for if Christ was a sinner,
he could not be a Saviour. He had not been a
meet offering for the sins of others; he had been a
sinner himself. But he was offered up a Lamb without
spot, (Heb. 7:26, 1&nbsp;Peter 1:19,) and was
made sin for us, that knew no sin, (2&nbsp;Cor. 5:2;) and
therefore this objection is made so gross, that every
sincere heart that sees the tendency of it will not
touch it; and indeed I had not mentioned it here,
but that many through weakness have taken it up
as a sufficient ground to prove the making void of the
Sabbath, for want of looking into the bottom of it.</p>

<p>6. Another ground to prove the Sabbath yet to
be in force, may be taken from the words of Christ
to his disciples in Matt. 24:20&mdash;<i>But pray ye that
your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath
day</i>; which is part of the answer Christ gave them
when they came privately to him to ask him when
the destruction of the temple should be, the signs
of his coming, and the end of the world. It is generally
conceived that this part of Christ's answer
relates to the destruction of Jerusalem; and, indeed,
that is the shortest time that can be thought it relates
to, as appears by the question which was asked
him. But suppose it to be so; doth it not plainly
appear from hence, that the Sabbath was to remain
in full force after the death of Christ? The destruction
of Jerusalem was about forty years after
the death of Christ, and yet he commands his disciples
to pray that their flight be not in the winter,
neither on the Sabbath day. Now, can we think that
Christ would lay such a foundation for superstition,
as though the Sabbath was to be at the ruin of Jerusalem,
when it was to cease at his death? Or can
<span class="pagenum">{16-34}</span>
we think that Christ would teach his disciples to
pray false, or to pray that their flight should not be on
the Sabbath, when indeed there was to be no Sabbath?
This is gross to imagine; for as sure as
winter was to remain winter, so the Sabbath was to
remain the Sabbath. And if their flight had been
upon it, it would have been the more tedious, it being
a day of rest and refreshment to them, wherein
they used to rejoice and praise the Lord, as appears
by that song for the Sabbath day, in Psalm
92. But although this Scripture looks to the destruction
of Jerusalem, yet I conceive that it looks
farther, even to that distress that Jerusalem shall be
in at the second coming of Christ, and that for
these reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Those things that Christ spake of were accomplished
in a measure in the apostles' days; and
yet they are not completely fulfilled. For instance,
Christ told his disciples that they should be delivered
up to be killed, and they should be hated of all
nations for his name's sake. This was in the apostles'
days, and hath been since; and false prophets
did arise then, and so they have since. So that
those things which Christ spake looked to several
times, and therefore, I conceive, he saith, <i>Verily I
say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all
these things be fulfilled.</i> So I judge that what he
spake concerning Jerusalem had not only respect
to that destruction that came upon it during that
generation, but also to that great calamity that
should be upon it in the last days.</p>

<p>2d. This will more plainly appear, if we consider
the words of Christ, <i>But pray ye that your flight
be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day; for then
shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning
of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall
be.</i> Matt. 24:20, 21. Now, with this compare
<span class="pagenum">{16-35}</span>
Zech. 14:2, <i>For I will gather all nations against
Jerusalem to battle, and they shall be taken, and the
houses rifled, and the women ravished.</i> And in the
third and fourth verses it is said, <i>Then shall the
Lord go forth and fight against those nations, as
when he fought in the day of battle, and his feet shall
stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.</i> With
which compare Dan. 12:1, 2, <i>And at that time shall
Michael stand up, the great Prince, which standeth for
the children of thy people; and there shall be a time
of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation,
even to that same time; and at that time thy people
shall be delivered, every one that shall be found, written
in the book. And many of them that sleep in the
dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life,
and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</i> Now,
if that great destruction of Jerusalem produced such
great trouble as never was, nor ever should be
again, how is it that there shall be such great
trouble as never was since there was a nation,
when Michael stands up to deliver the people,
every one that is written in the book, and Jerusalem
is taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished,
when the Lord comes forth to fight against
those nations, and his feet shall stand upon the
Mount of Olives, according to that text in Acts 1:11,
<i>So shall he come in like manner as ye have seen
him go into heaven</i>; and when the seventh angel
pours out his vial, (Rev. 16:17, 18,) which time I
conceive is one and the same with that in Zechariah
and Daniel&mdash;and the angel is Michael, the great
prince which Daniel speaks of, whose feet shall
stand upon the Mount of Olives&mdash;then is the time of
great trouble, and such an earthquake as was not
since men were upon the face of the earth, so mighty
an earthquake and so great. So that to me it appears,
that these three Scriptures do correspond with
<span class="pagenum">{16-36}</span>
the words of Christ, pointing out the same time;
and if so, then the Sabbath shall remain till the
coming of Christ, and so shall stand till heaven and
earth pass away, according to the passage in Matt.
5:18; and for ever and ever, according to that in
Psalm 111:8; and the destruction of Jerusalem
seems to be a type of that great destruction that
shall be at Christ's appearance. And, as Jerusalem
was taken when some from all nations were gathered
together, as history reports, and on the Sabbath
day it was destroyed, so it appears that the strength
of the saints will be gathered together at Jerusalem,
because all nations will gather against it, and Jerusalem's
strait will be upon the Sabbath day, as
seems to appear by the words of Christ, for then,
saith he, shall be great tribulation, such as never
was; (then! when? why, when their flight shall be
upon the Sabbath day;) and this great tribulation is
when Jerusalem shall be taken, the houses rifled,
and the women ravished, as was said before; <i>at
which time Michael shall stand up and fight against
these nations, as when he fought in the day of battle;
and the slain of the Lord shall be many, even from
one end of the earth to the other</i>, (Jer. 25:31-33,)
<i>and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst
thereof, and there shall be a very great valley, into
which the saints shall flee</i>, (Zech. 14:5.) Then
shall the Sabbath be swallowed up in the great Sabbath
of a thousand years, that glorious and holy
rest which the saints shall enter into, and live and
reign with Christ. Rev. 20:4.</p>

<p>7. Another ground is taken from the practice of
Christ's disciples after his death, as recorded in
Luke 23:5, 6, <i>And they returned and prepared spices
and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according
to the commandment.</i> Some say, that if we do observe
the Sabbath, we must do all those sacrifices which
<span class="pagenum">{16-37}</span>
the Jews did upon it. But at this time the veil of the
temple was rent in twain from top to bottom, and
the shadows were done away by the body of Christ,
and yet they kept the Sabbath, not through fear or
ignorance, but according to the commandment,
which is to rest from their labors; and so they did,
for the text saith, <i>they returned and rested</i>. There
is no sacrifice expressed in the commandment, <i>The
stranger and the cattle were to rest on the Sabbath.</i>
Exod. 20:10. So that the Sabbath was commanded
and observed before any of those sacrifices were
commanded to be offered upon it. But because the
Jews did such a service upon the Sabbath day, as
they were a typical people, it doth not follow that
this was any part of the commandment; and therefore
we are to rest, as those disciples did, according
to the commandment. It is remarkable, that the
Holy Ghost should leave this thing upon record,
which would not have been, I am persuaded, had
the Sabbath then been abolished. He doth not
only say, they returned and rested on the Sabbath
day, but, to prevent all mistakes, lest it should be
thought they did it ignorantly or superstitiously, or
for fear of the Jews, he saith they did it groundedly,
that is, according to the commandment.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But the disciples were met together upon
the first day of the week, and Christ appeared unto
them. John 20:9.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> It is true, they were assembled together
upon the same day at even, being the first day of the
week, with the door shut; and the cause is laid
down why they were so, namely, for fear of the
Jews. Some of the disciples, as I said before, kept
the Sabbath the day before, and I think we can not reasonably
imagine but that those did who were together
on the first day, for they did frequently correspond
<span class="pagenum">{16-38}</span>
together, that is manifest. But what doth their being
together on the first day evening, and Christ's
appearing to them, prove for the observation of the
first day, more than his appearing to them eight
days after, and appearing to them the third time
early in the morning when they were fishing, (John
21:4, 5,) for the observation of those days? It
was necessary that Christ should appear to his disciples
on the first day of the week, that his word
might be fulfilled of his rising the third day, so that
they might boldly witness the same.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But the disciples came together on the first
day of the week, and did break bread, and Paul
preached unto them. Acts 20.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> This is all the meeting or preaching that
ever we find held upon the first day, except the disciples
being together for fear of the Jews, mentioned
before, at evening. So this seemed to be,
because when they came together Paul preached
with them, continuing his speech until midnight.
It is not likely, then, that they observed the day and
came together in the morning, seeing he continued
his speech so long. And, as we have the cause of
the disciples being together with their doors shut,
so we have the cause of this meeting. Paul was
ready to depart on the morrow upon an extraordinary
occasion, and he had many things to communicate
to them, as appears by his discoursing with
them till midnight, and talking till break of day.
But that which makes the objectors lay such stress
upon this text, is because the disciples came together
to break bread, which they judge to be the Lord's
Supper. Suppose it were so, what doth this make
for the observation of the first day, more than
Christ's first instituting the Supper upon the fifth
day of the week, (as is generally conceived,) doth
<span class="pagenum">{16-39}</span>
make for the observation of it? But we have no
proof that this was the Supper of the Lord that
they came to partake of, but it seems to be such
breaking of bread as the margin of some Bibles refers
to. Acts 2:46. <i>They continued daily with one
accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house
to house, and did eat their meat with gladness of heart.</i>
So in Luke 24:30, 35. And it is explained what
kind of breaking of bread it was, where it is said,
when he was risen up again, and had broken bread
and eaten, and talked a good while, till break of day,
he departed. Here is eating and talking; it is not
solemnized as the Lord's Supper. Some would
have this common breaking of bread, and the other
in verse 7, to be the Lord's Supper; but it is very
unlikely that there should be two sorts of breaking
of bread at one time, by the same persons, and
yet nothing spoken distinctly by which we might
know the one from the other. The most that can
be said, is but a supposition; it can not be proved
that this was the Lord's Supper. How weak a
ground this is for the observation of this day as a
Sabbath, or more than any other day, or to limit
the administration of the Lord's Supper to this day,
I leave to the truly wise in heart to judge.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But the church had their gatherings upon
the first day of the week, by which it appears that
it was the day that they met together upon. 1&nbsp;Cor.
16:2.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The words are these, <i>Upon the first day of
the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as
God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings
when I come</i>. Here is no proof of their meeting
together, but rather the contrary, every one was to
lay by him in store as God had prospered him; no
public gathering, but private laying up. But because
<span class="pagenum">{16-40}</span>
the Apostle saith, in the close of the verse,
<i>that there be no gatherings when I come</i>, therefore it
is thought the Scripture can not be so understood,
because it would not prevent gatherings. But is
this fair, when a text of Scripture stands alone, to
put such a sense upon it as doth contradict the very
letter of it&mdash;when it saith, let every one of you
lay by him in store, then to say the meaning is to
have public gatherings and but one store? And
would not the end of the Apostle be fully answered,
namely, to have no gatherings, if each of them did
lay by in store, as God had prospered them in
the world, ready against the Apostle came, they
knowing of his coming? And when he came, was
it not as easy to carry it with them to him, as for us
to carry our Bibles to a meeting; and what need
would there be then of gatherings? And this way
of giving would not be pharisee-like, but according
to the words of Christ, in Matt. 6:1-4, <i>Take heed
that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them;
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is
in heaven. But when thou doest thine alms, let not thy
left hand know what thy right hand doeth; that thine
alms may be in secret; and thy Father which seeth
in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.</i></p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But John was in the spirit on the Lord's
day, (and had the various revelations upon it,) which
is conceived to be the first day of the week. Rev.
1:10.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> It is true, John was in the spirit on the
Lord's day. But the question will be, what day that
was. If any particular one of the seven, it must
have been the Sabbath, for no other day is so called
but that. God calls it his holy day in Isa. 58:13,
and Christ saith he is Lord even of the Sabbath day.
And if so, then it is his day, for he is Lord of it,
<span class="pagenum">{16-41}</span>
and that by way of eminence; not, as some would
have it, to show that he is Lord of every day, but
as it is the Sabbath; for so it is said the Son of Man
is Lord even of the Sabbath day. So that this notion
that the Lord's day is the first day, is merely
taken up on trust one from another, without one
word of Scripture to prove it.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But it will be yet objected, by those that are
for no Sabbath, in the words of the Apostle in Col.
2:16, 17, <i>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or
in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the new-moon,
or of the Sabbath-days, which are a shadow
of things to come, but the body is of Christ</i>; whence
it is concluded that the Sabbath was but a shadow,
and none are to be judged for not observing it.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> There were holy-days and Sabbaths besides
the seventh-day Sabbath, or the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God, for so it is called in the commandment,
as doth appear in Lev. 23:39. Now, because
it is implied by the words of the Apostle, that
Sabbaths were shadows, to be done away by the
body of Christ, doth it therefore follow that all
Sabbaths were so, any more than the words of the
Apostle that men shall be saved, prove that all
men shall be saved? And if we consider the
verses before, it will plainly appear, that the Apostle
was not speaking of any of the ten commandments.
In verse 15, the Apostle is speaking to the
Gentiles, showing how they were dead in sins, and in
the uncircumcision of their flesh, but are now quickened
by Christ, and all their trespasses forgiven
them. In verse 14, he shows what farther benefit
they had by the death of Christ, Blotting out the
hand-writing of ordinances, which was against us,
and contrary to us, he took it out of the way, nailing
it to his cross; and the Scripture on which the
<span class="pagenum">{16-42}</span>
objection is founded hath its dependence upon that
which comes in with, Therefore let no man judge
you in meats, and drinks, &amp;c.; as though the Apostle
had said, Forasmuch as Christ hath blotted out
and nailed to his cross those ordinances which are
against the Gentiles, you are not to be judged for the
non-performance of them. Now the ten commandments
were never against the Gentiles, nor contrary
to them; for the same Apostle saith the matter of
them was written in their hearts, as was said before,
and they did by nature the things contained in them,
and therefore they were not contrary to them. But
circumcision and other ordinances stood as a wall
against the Gentiles, which Christ broke down, by
taking them out of the way and nailing them to the
cross, <i>having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even
the law of commandments contained in ordinances,
for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making
peace that he might reconcile both unto God in
one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby</i>.
Eph. 2:15. So that it is clear, that the Apostle is
speaking of such commandments as were contained
in ordinances, and not those commandments that
were eminently distinguished from ordinances; but
those ordinances which were against the Gentiles,
and made them and the Jews two, as did drinks,
new-moons, holy-days, and Sabbath-days, Christ by
his blood having taken these away, hath made
them one. That the ten commandments should be
struck at, there is no cover in this Scripture for,
or that the Sabbath should only be taken from them
and nailed to the cross with new-moons, meats, and
other shadows and ordinances which were against
man. But Christ saith, The Sabbath was made for
man. So that in this place there is no proof for the
abrogation of this command of God. But for a
more full answer see my other book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-43}</span>
<i>Obj.</i> How is it that the Apostle saith, in Rom.
14:5, 6, <i>that one man esteemeth one day above another,
another esteemeth every day alike</i>, and yet he
does not reprove either of them?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> I make no doubt but if the controversy
here alluded to had been about the Sabbath, whether
it were to be observed or not, it would have been
plainly expressed, and not passed over so slightly.
But the Apostle is speaking of <i>indifferent things</i>,
which men were not to be judged for their doing
or not doing, and not of commandments. Because
it is said that some esteem every day alike, therefore
some conclude that this takes away the Sabbath
day; but we must compare Scripture with
Scripture, adopt such a sense as may bring them
into harmony, and sometimes explain general
terms by restrictive Scriptures. For instance,
Christ says to his disciples, <i>Go preach the gospel to
every creature</i>; we must understand it to mean to
every creature that is in a condition to hear the gospel.
The Apostle saith, that every creature of God
is good, and nothing to be refused. But some are
poison, and are to be refused. So is every day
alike, that is, every working day, which God hath
made alike; but the seventh day he hath sanctified
and made a Sabbath of rest, and so not like the
others. This interpretation is according to that
Scripture in Exod. 16:4, <i>Behold, I will rain bread
from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and
gather a certain rate every day</i>; and in verse 12, <i>They
gathered every morning every man according to his
eating, yet on the Sabbath day there was none to
gather.</i> And in our common speech it is so; we
call the six days every day. Men say, we work
every day, or we travel so far every day, when they
mean only the six days that they count working
<span class="pagenum">{16-44}</span>
days. So the Apostle, speaking to them that kept
the Sabbath, speaks in the same language, and we
have no ground to think otherwise; for there is no
Scripture that we find before this that hath any
seeming dislike against the observation of the Sabbath,
but the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Obj. Ye observe days, and years, and times, and
months; I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed
upon you labor in vain.</i> Gal. 4:10, 11.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> This cannot be understood that the Apostle
here strikes at the mere observation of days, a
thing of such dangerous consequence, for he would
not have them judged that observed one day above
another. In Rom, 14:5, 6, and in this place, he
himself judges these as persons that had so far degenerated,
that he was afraid he had bestowed upon
them labor in vain; but it is manifest that these
Galatians were gone back to circumcision, and so
were debtors to the whole law, seeking justification
thereby. Gal. 5:2-4. So they observed days
and years, according to the law that was a shadow
of good things to come, solemnizing the days, and
months, and years, with those things that were appointed
for them, as burnt-offerings, meat-offerings,
the waving of the sheaf, the Passover, and Feast
of Unleavened Bread, and the like, as may be seen
at large in Lev. 23:8-11; for they could not be
said to observe times, and months and years, according
to the law, except they did such service.
And this gave the Apostle just ground to fear that
he had bestowed on them labor in vain. But to imagine
that to observe the Sabbath according to the
commandment, or to observe a day voluntarily to
the Lord, is so dangerous, is contrary both to Scripture
and reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-45}</span>
<i>Obj.</i> We who believe are entered into rest,
of which the Sabbath was but a type, as appeals by
the words of the Apostle in Heb. 4:3.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> If eternal rest by faith be the antitype of
the Sabbath, the Sabbath ceased to be in force to
every man so soon as he believed; which is ridiculous
to think, and contrary to the current of Scripture.
But the Apostle saith, <i>We who believe do
enter into rest; for he that is entered into his rest is
ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let
us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
fall after the example of unbelief.</i> Heb. 4:10, 11.
Mind this chapter well, and I am persuaded you
will see that the drift of the Apostle, in mentioning
the seventh day here, is but to amplify and set forth
that perfect rest which they that believe do and
shall enjoy, of which the land of Canaan was but a
type; and to show that God's rest was before the
Land of Canaan, and that there yet remains a rest
to the people of God. As God did rest the seventh
day from all his works, so they that enter into rest
do cease from their own works, as God did from
his. And this is not as soon as men believe, for the
Apostle provokes himself and others which were
believers to labor to enter into it. And therefore,
if you will have the Sabbath, a type from this Scripture,
though it is nowhere so called, it must be a
type of eternal rest, which saints do enter into when
they cease from their own works, as God did from
his. And that will not be till they lay down this
tabernacle, which will not affect the thing asserted.
And indeed I cannot deny but the Sabbath is an
earnest of that rest, and saints that are spiritual in
the observation of it find it so, and of great use
to put them in mind of that glorious rest, as the bread
and wine in the Lord's Supper put us in mind of the
<span class="pagenum">{16-46}</span>
sufferings of Christ; so this being a day of rest and
delight, being striped of all worldly incumbrances,
and devoted to the Lord, to pray unto him, and to
praise his holy name, to meditate upon heaven and
heavenly glory.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But many say, If the Sabbath be in force,
then the penalty must needs be so, and then those
that do not keep it must be stoned; therefore this
opinion is dangerous, and will lead saints to destroy
one another.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> This is a very showy objection, but indeed
it is a very weak one. I do not find that any more
than one was stoned, and it was for presumptuous
breaking of the Sabbath. But suppose that penalty
be in force; every saint is not a magistrate to put it
in execution. If a saint should kill a man, saints as
they are saints are not to execute him; all that
they can do is to endeavor his repentance, but it belongs
to the true magistrate to inflict the punishment.
The penal laws of God take hold of presumptuous
sinners, not for sins of ignorance, and
therefore it is not to be thought that any punishment
will be inflicted upon any for a breach of the
Sabbath till it be universally acknowledged. So
then, if God hath annexed the penalty of death to
the breaking of it, doubtless it will be just. But
we find in Nehemiah's time, that although they had
made a market-day of the Sabbath, treading of
wine-presses, lading of asses, and selling of all
manner of provisions upon it, yet he doth but contend
with them. He contends with the Jews of Jerusalem,
the nobles of Judah, and the men of Tyre,
but inflicts no punishment on either. Neh. 13:15-17,
21. But what a strange thing is this, that men
should count it a dangerous opinion, to hold that the
Sabbath is in force, because of the penalty! Suppose
<span class="pagenum">{16-47}</span>
it be so; the same may be said of the rest of
the commandments. For instance, the first commandment
is, <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before
me</i>; he that worshiped a strange god was to be put
to death. Now, shall we not own this commandment,
because the breakers of it were so punished?
Again, <i>He that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall
his blood be shed.</i> Now, is there any danger in the
owning of this commandment, <i>Thou shalt do no
murder</i>, because the punishment is in force? Again,
the fifth commandment is, <i>Honor thy father and thy
mother</i>, but he that cursed father or mother was to be
put to death. Now, shall we not honor father and
mother, and so shall we break this commandment,
because this punishment belongs to the breakers of
it? So this objection is of no weight or use at all,
except it be as a bear-skin put upon the truth to
frighten children away, lest they should look into it.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But we do not find any of the apostles urge
this commandment in any of their epistles, namely,
that the Sabbath day should be observed.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Neither do we find the apostles urging the
first, second, or third commandment in particular,
as laid down in the table, but they are frequently
urged in the general, as in Rom. 7:12, 13:8-10,
and generals comprehend particulars. James saith,
<i>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, yet offend in one
point, is guilty of all</i>; and he proves it thus, <i>Because
he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
kill; now, if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou
kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</i> The
same argument may be drawn from the thing in
hand. He that saith, Do not commit adultery, saith
also, Keep the Sabbath; now, if thou commit no
adultery, yet if thou break the Sabbath, thou art
become a transgressor of the law. James 2:10, 11.
<span class="pagenum">{16-48}</span>
And Paul saith, <i>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision
is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments
of God.</i> 1&nbsp;Cor. 7:19. John saith, in his
first epistle, chapter 5:2, 3, <i>By this we know that
we love the children of God, when we love God and
keep his commandments; for this is the love of God,
that we keep his commandments, and his commandments
are not grievous.</i> And if the apostles had not
spoken a word to this commandment, in general or
in particular, it is no ground for us to lay it by, except
the observation of it were forbidden, because
it is so plainly commanded by God, explained by
Christ, observed by his disciples, both before and
after his death, as was said before, and will farther
appear by and by.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But we do not find that any of the churches
kept the Sabbath.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> That is no proof that they did not keep it. But
it is clear that the church of Jerusalem kept it, though
it is not plainly expressed, for they were so zealous
for the very customs, that Paul is counseled to purify
himself, lest they should be offended at him.
Acts 21:21, 24. Now, if they were for the observation
of those things that were but shadows, there
is no doubt but they were very strict for the observation
of the Sabbath. And there was such offence
taken against Paul for preaching against circumcision
and the customs, that we need not question, if the
Sabbath had been preached against, but we should
have heard a great noise of it in the Scriptures, and
seen strong convincing reasons why it was abolished.
And it is as clear that the apostles kept the Sabbath
after the resurrection of Christ as before. <i>Paul
went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat
down, and after the reading of the law preached the
gospel, and told them of the ignorance of those that
<span class="pagenum">{16-49}</span>
dwelt at Jerusalem of the voice of the prophets
which were read every Sabbath day. And the Gentiles
besought him that these words might be spoken to
them the next Sabbath. And the next Sabbath came
almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</i>
Acts 13:14, 15, 42, 44. So that it is clear, that
the Sabbath was Paul's resting-day and preaching-day,
both to the Jews and Gentiles, that being the
day that the Gentiles used to hear; and though they
had a desire to hear the same words again, yet it
must be next Sabbath; and Paul fulfills their desire,
and preaches to them the next Sabbath, and almost
the whole city came to hear. Can we think, if there
had been no Sabbath, that Paul would have countenanced
them so in their ignorance? Or, if the first
day had been a day that was observed, would he
not have told them so, that they might have heard
the word before the next Sabbath. And when
Paul came to Philippi, a Gentile city, mind what is
said in Acts 16:12, 13, <i>We were in that city abiding
certain days, and on the Sabbath day we went out
of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to
be made, and we sat down and spake unto the women
that resorted thither.</i> The seventh day hath its title
still, as is said by the Spirit in Acts; speaking of
certain days, this is singled out and called the Sabbath
day, with an account how they spent it, and
the blessing they received upon it; they resorted to
the place of prayer, and there they preached, and
the Lord opened Lydia's heart to attend to the
words of Paul. And in Acts 17:2, it is said, <i>That
Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.</i>
And when Paul came to Corinth, which was a Gentile
city, and found Aquila, a Jew, and his wife Priscilla,
and because they were of the same craft, he
abode with them, and wrought, for by occupation
<span class="pagenum">{16-50}</span>
they were tent-makers, <i>he reasoned in the synagogue
every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews and
Greeks</i>. Acts 18:2-4. So that it is manifest, that
the Greeks kept the Sabbath as well as the Jews,
and that though Paul wrought at his trade and
made tents, yet he rested every Sabbath day; and
as we have an account how he spent his time, namely,
in working at his trade, so we have an account
how he spent his time on the Sabbath. Now, if
it be such a strong argument for the observation
of the first day, because Paul preached upon it
once; what is this for the observation of the seventh
day, that Paul did not only preach constantly
upon it, but wherever the Spirit speaks of it he
calls it the Sabbath day, without the least hint that
he did so out of condescension to the weakness of
others? And let it be shown by the Scriptures that
the apostles did countenance and own any shadow
that was done away, as they owned and countenanced
the keeping of the Sabbath, and we may follow
the apostles as they followed the Lord in this matter,
though we have no express word that the
churches kept it. And, indeed, I think I may say
in this case, as the Apostle said in another, that it
would have been superfluous for the apostles to have
told any people in their time that such and such a
church kept the Sabbath; it being a truth not so
much as questioned, that we hear of, but Jews and
Gentiles both observed it. But now I cease answering
objections, as I have spoken to those that
are the most material of them that I have heard,
and I shall proceed to another ground.</p>

<p>8. Consider the bondage and slavery that both
man and beast would be in if this doctrine were
received for truth. Would it not now, however
have the tendency to bring the world more to atheism?
<span class="pagenum">{16-51}</span>
Some men would not allow themselves nor
their servants time to rest, or hear the word of God,
if they were persuaded that there was no Sabbath;
yea, and the greater part of saints are left to the
mercy of merciless men, most of them being children,
and wives, and servants; and they cannot challenge
a day in seven, or a day in seventy, as their
right to rest upon, and to worship the Lord in, from
any commandment of God, if this doctrine be true,
that the Sabbath is abolished. And were this but
to bring a yoke of bondage upon us, that neither
we nor our fathers were able to bear, we should
not so much as take notice at this time how it goes
in probability, for the way of numbering is by sevens.</p>

<p>But some will say, It is good to observe one day
in seven, though it be not a constant day. This will
be confessed, for one to observe one day, and another
to observe another day, while others are for
a seventh day to be constantly observed. But why
not the seventh day which God hath commanded,
for the seventh day is the Sabbath? It plainly appears,
that there is something of the table-law yet
upon the table of the hearts of most men, though
worn by much transgression; for men generally
plead to have one day in seven to rest in, and yet
because of custom they contend against this holy, just
law of God, that was made in mercy for man. I am
persuaded in my very heart, and that not without
good ground, that if the seventh day had been observed
as the first day is, no man that owns the
Scriptures would have questioned whether it ought
to be observed or not, or at least no opposition
would have been made against it; and when all is
said, custom and worldly interest are the two great
things that stand in opposition to it.</p>

<p>9. And lastly, consider those great and precious
promises made to them that keep the Sabbath according
to the inside and spirituality of it; not that
<span class="pagenum">{16-52}</span>
we are so to spiritualize it as to make void the letter,
but according to the letter, as Christ doth. For
instance, he saith, <i>Ye have heard that it hath been said
of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I
say unto you, Whosoever looketh on a woman and lusteth
after her, hath committed adultery with her in his
heart.</i> Now, if it be adultery to lust, doubtless it
is to act, and this is forbidden in the commandment,
for the commandment is, <i>Thou shall not commit
adultery</i>; but Christ unfolds this commandment,
and gives such a sense of it as the scribes and pharisees
understood not. Again, the sixth commandment
is, <i>Thou shalt do no murder</i>; and John saith,
<i>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.</i> John 3:15.
Now, all murder was forbidden in the commandment,
yet this was not understood to be murder;
but John obeyed the spirituality of the commandment.
And the same may be said of the fourth
commandment, <i>Remember the Sabbath day to keep
it holy</i>; all servile work is forbidden in it, and that
the pharisees understood; but they did not understand
that works of mercy, as curing the sick, and
healing the diseased, might be done upon it. Neither
did they understand that inward and spiritual rest
that was held out in the commandment, as appears
by the words of the Lord in Isa. 58:13, 14, <i>If thou
turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a
delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and shalt
honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words.</i>
So that the saints are not only to cease from outward
work in their callings, but also from works
that are inward and spiritually wicked, that so the
Sabbath may be a delight unto them, the holy of
the Lord, honorable. And mark the promise that
is to such Sabbath-keepers, in the fourteenth verse,
<i>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, and I
<span class="pagenum">{16-53}</span>
will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,
and will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father;
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</i> First,
they shall delight themselves in the Lord, and that
will make the Sabbath a delight. Second, they
shall ride upon the high places of the earth; the
high places of the earth holding forth, as I conceive,
the great opposition, whether of great and mighty
men, or great walled cities, according to that in
Deut. 1:28, which hath an allusion to Israel's subduing
the land of Canaan. Deut. 32:13. Thou shalt
ride upon them, that is, subdue and conquer them.
Psalm 45:4, 66:12. <i>They shall tread upon their
high places.</i> Deut. 33:39. <i>They shall be as ashes
under the soles of their feet.</i> Mal. 4:3. Now, when
did the Lord's people do such work as this since
this prophesy? or, is it yet to be fulfilled?</p>

<p>Again, consider what the Lord saith in Isa. 56:6,
7, <i>Also the sons of the stranger that join themselves
to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the
Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the
Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant,
even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and
make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt
offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon
mine altar, for mine house shall be called an house of
prayer to all people.</i> By the sons of the stranger,
I understand is here meant Gentiles, who were
strangers to the commonwealth of Israel and afar off,
but are now made nigh by the blood of Christ, and
so they join themselves to the Lord, and serve him,
and love the name of the Lord; these are such as
keep the Sabbath, and take hold of God's covenant,
and it is such a Sabbath as may be polluted, and
therefore not Christ's, as some would have it. Now,
the promises that are made to these strangers, do
look at clear gospel times.</p>

<p>They shall be brought into God's holy mountain,
<span class="pagenum">{16-54}</span>
and there be made joyful, when it is so mountainous
that it is the house of prayer for all people, or
for all nations, as Christ saith in Matt. 11:17.
<i>Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man
that taketh hold on it, that keepeth the Sabbath from
polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any
evil. Thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep
my Sabbath, and choose the things that please me, and
take hold on my covenant, even unto them will I give a
name and a place better than of sons and daughters;
I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be
cut off.</i> Isa. 56:2, 4, 5. The eunuchs are such as
care for the things that please the Lord, when the
married careth for the things that please his wife.
Cor. 7:32, 33. And when two parts shall be cut
off and die, the eunuchs that keep the Sabbath shall
have an everlasting name, which shall not be cut off.</p>

<p>Now, let us not think it incredible that the Sabbath
should be yet in force, because it hath been
so long laid aside; it hath been so with other truths,
and so with this, before now. It seemed to be so
out of knowledge with Israel in the wilderness, that
when the people had gathered twice as much manna
on the sixth day, they did not understand the meaning
of it; but the nobles came and told Moses, and
he told them what the Lord had said, that to-morrow
should be the rest of the holy Sabbath. And
also, after their coming out of Babylon, when they
had built the house of God, and set it in order, placing
the priests and Levites, and had chosen faithful
men to distribute the maintenance to their brethren.
Neh. 13:10, 13. In a word, their reformation was
much about the light of ours, and it is confessed by
the enlightened that it was a type of this reformation
that the Lord hath begun amongst us in these
isles, namely, in bringing his people out of Babylon,
and building up of Zion; and, indeed, as their sins
and ours are alike in many things, so in this, namely
<span class="pagenum">{16-55}</span>
in breaking the fourth commandment; for Nehemiah
saith, in chap. 13:15, that in those days he
saw in Judah some treading wine-presses on the
Sabbath, and lading asses, and bringing in sheaves,
as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens,
which they brought into Jerusalem upon the
Sabbath day; and he testified against them in the
day wherein they sold victuals. Notwithstanding
all the reformation, yet this was seen in Judah.
They had laid by the observation of the Sabbath,
and had made it a common working, market day, as
may be seen at large in that chapter. It was not in
vain, therefore, that the Lord said, <i>Remember the Sabbath</i>,
he foreseeing how it would be slighted and
forgotten, not only by those that were brought out
of literal Babylon, but also by those that should be
brought out of spiritual Babylon in the latter days;
and when the day of the Lord burns as an oven, it
will be remembered to some purpose. Mal. 4:4.
In the mean time, the Lord is stirring up some of his
poor babes and sucklings. Such he is pleased usually
to discover truth unto at the first breaking out
of it, and they are to contend for it, though in much
weakness.</p>

<p>But a word to the beginning and ending of the
Sabbath. There are various apprehensions about
it, which, for brevity's sake, I shall omit. The
Scripture is plain, that from evening to evening is
the set time, or from the going down of the sun to
the going down of the sun. This is clear from the
beginning, according to Gen. 1:5, <i>The evening and
the morning was the first day</i>. The evening and
morning make a complete natural day, and the evening
goeth before the morning, because the darkness
was before the light.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But some will say, It is not said the evening
and the morning was the seventh day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{16-56}</span>
<i>Ans.</i> If the evening and the morning be the
sixth day, the evening and the morning must needs
be the seventh day, unless we should think that the
seventh day hath no night belonging to it. Some
think that the reason why no mention is made of the
evening of the seventh day, is, because the Sabbath
is a day of joy and delight, or an earnest of the
new Jerusalem state, wherein shall be no night.
Rev. 21:25. Night doth frequently, in the Scripture,
hold forth a state of affliction, but the Sabbath
is a holy, sanctified time; on it the Creator rested
and was refreshed, and commanded the observation
of it that his creatures might be refreshed.</p>

<p>Nehemiah's practice is sufficient proof for the beginning
of the Sabbath at evening, (chap. 13:19,)
who, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
dark, commanded them to be shut till after the Sabbath.
And if you would know when the evening
begins, the evangelist Mark doth inform you in
chapter 1:32, <i>At even, when the sun did set, they
brought unto him all that were diseased</i>. When the
sun doth set, then begins the evening, then begins
the holy rest or seventh-day Sabbath. So the
disciples of Christ began the Sabbath; and so the
Lord's ancient people celebrate the Sabbath unto
this day.</p>

<p>But what confusion are they in who say the Sabbath
was changed from the seventh day to the first
day, and yet observe neither, but part of the first
day and part of the second day; for they begin
their Sabbath at midnight, when a good part of the
first day is spent, and they end at midnight, when a
good part of the second day is spent; and yet they
will have this to be a Sabbath, yea, and a first day
Sabbath, and will highly charge a man to be an offender
if he work one hour upon the first day,
though themselves work five; and thus we see how
anti-Christ hath changed times as well as laws; a
<span class="pagenum">{16-57}</span>
first-day Sabbath instead of a seventh-day Sabbath;
instead of from even to even, from midnight to midnight,
when most are fast asleep, being insensible
of the beginning of their Sabbath, or the ending
of it.</p>

<p>But, blessed be the Lord, that he hath revealed
this his ancient, useful, and honorable truth, to wit,
the holy seventh-day Sabbath, notwithstanding all
the inventions of anti-Christ to bury it in oblivion,
and that he is pleased to separate a remnant, that
are resolved to search and try their ways, and to
turn unto him, to follow him in the ways of his precepts,
(notwithstanding the dragon's wrath,) who
will not take things upon trust, nor go upon the legs
of men, but will try all things, and hold fast that
which is good, for they are virgins, and they will
follow the Lamb, though their company be small
and their charge great. They will not be afraid of
the Sabbath because it was given to the Jews, any
more than they are afraid of the adoption, and the
glory, and the promises, and the other nine lively
oracles, which were all given to the Jews. Rom.
9:4. And this I may modestly say, to the praise
of the Lord of the Sabbath, and without boasting,
that if the saints did know how the Lord delights
to meet with his people in this way of obedience
in celebrating the Sabbath, they would soon call the
Sabbath <i>a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable</i>,
and honor him by ceasing from their own works, as
God did from his, and doing those works which are
suitable for the blessed season. But I shall say no
more at present, save only this, that whoever they
are that would follow the Lord in this appointment
of his, they must labor much in the strength of his
Spirit to get this world under them, for it stands in
direct opposition to earthly men, and earthly principles;
therefore pray with the Psalmist, <i>Incline
my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness</i>.</p>

<h3>PART I.<br /><br />
NARRATIVE OF RECENT EVENTS</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

</div>

<p>On the 13th of December, 1847, I landed with
my family in Port-au-Prince, Haïti, the first Foreign
Missionary of the Reformed Presbyterian Church
in the United States. I began my labors soon afterwards,
and continued them, without serious interruption,
till the 21st of April, 1849, when a train
of circumstances, to which I am about to advert,
made it necessary that I should return home.</p>

<p>In the latter part of December, 1848, I was unexpectedly
called upon to defend the practice of
keeping holy the first day of the week, in place of
the seventh. I had been taught from my infancy,
that the moral law, "summarily comprehended in
the ten commandments," is the only rule of moral
conduct; and I had supposed, that it required me
and everybody else to keep the "Christian Sabbath"
on the first day of the week. On examination,
however, I was forced to the conclusion, that
the fourth commandment enjoins nothing else than
the sanctification of the seventh day. Of course,
then, I must either renounce this precept, as a part
of the rule of my life, or endeavor to keep holy the
seventh day of the week. The former I might not
dare to do; the latter I knew I might <i>attempt</i>, without
offending God, or insulting the majesty of his
law.</p>

<p>The question then came up, Is there any scripture
<span class="pagenum">{17-4}</span>
authority for keeping holy the first day? Does
God require it? I knew very well, that if God
does <i>not</i> require it, I could not, as a Reformed
Presbyterian, bind my conscience to it. I took up
the Bible, resolved on a prayerful and thorough
search. I wished to assure myself of the divine authority
of the first day, even after I was satisfied
that the claims of the seventh are indisputable. But
how was it possible to gain this object? Every
text to which I was referred for proof seemed to
lack the very thing that I most wanted, <i>a certain
testimony to the institution of a Christian Sabbath</i>.
I reasoned thus:&mdash;The fact that Christ appeared
once or twice to his disciples on the first day of the
week, and the fact that the disciples met <i>once</i> on
that day to break bread, and the fact that Paul commanded
the Corinthians and Galatians to 'lay by
them in store' on that day, as God had prospered
them&mdash;these facts, with a few others, <i>might</i> shed
light on the <i>institution</i>, if <i>one single text</i> could be
found, to prove its <i>existence</i>. But if this can not be
found, they do not touch the question at issue. And
how I did long for that <i>one text</i>! How I chided
with the Apostles for not having made known more
clearly what I had determined to be the will of
God! Never did Rachel mourn for her children,
as I mourned for that <i>one text</i>; but, like her, I
could not be comforted, because <i>it was not</i>!</p>

<p>I was thus driven to the conclusion, that, should
I make conscience of keeping holy the first day of
the week, I would offer to God a service that he
did not require, and could not accept at my hands.</p>

<p>But what was I to do? This was the great <i>practical</i>
question. Could I, with my then present views,
continue to preach the gospel, as I had done before,
in that "land of darkness, and of the shadow of
death?" Could I teach the children in the school,
<span class="pagenum">{17-5}</span>
as I had taught them before, that God had changed
the Sabbath to the first day of the week? Could I
proclaim to the benighted heathen, that they might
habitually break the fourth commandment with impunity?
Could I, as a Protestant missionary, become
the partizan of him who thought "to change
times and laws,"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
by assuring his blinded devotees,
that his changes had been made by divine authority?
Or, on the other hand, could I carry out my
convictions of truth and duty, declaring the whole
counsel of God, as I then understood it, and retain,
at the same time, my connection with my brethren
at home? Would they grant me this privilege, and,
if they would, could I accept it?</p>

<p>A little reflection served to convince me, that all
these questions must be answered in the negative.
It was no small matter, to resolve upon breaking
those bonds of ecclesiastical fellowship that had so
sweetly bound me to the Reformed Presbyterian
Church. A struggle, painful indeed, but not protracted,
ensued. I resolved at once to keep the
Sabbath in my family, though I feared it would not
be honest to make any <i>public</i> exhibition of my views,
while I continued to minister by the authority of the
Synod. I know not what I should have done, had
not my change of sentiments brought with it the
needed consolations. Whatever were the "vexing
thoughts" with which my heart was oppressed, during
the first six days of the week, I found invariably,
in the quiet retreat of my little family, on the
seventh, that "peace of God that passeth all understanding."
Yes, Haïti, when the recollection of thy
brilliant skies, thy evergreen mountains, and thy
<span class="pagenum">{17-6}</span>
sweet clear rivers, shall have ceased to awaken joy
in my bosom, the memory of thy Sabbaths shall be
"my songs in the house of my pilgrimage!"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>Convinced as I was, that something must be done
immediately to bring the subject of my change to
the attention of the rulers of our church, before the
next meeting of Synod, I prepared the following
Circular Letter, which I transmitted to more than
seventy ministers and elders, in different parts of the
United States.</p>

 <p class="center small">CIRCULAR.</p>

 <div class="sigbloc">
 <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Port-au-Prince</span>, Haïti, Jan. 17, 1849.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="small">

 <p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;The mutual relation existing between us,
 as members of the same Synod, the glory of our common Lord, the
 interests of our Mission, and a sacred regard for personal character,
 all require, that the following statement be transmitted to you and
 my other co-presbyters, with as little delay as possible. If I am not
 actuated herein by a desire to promote God's glory and the salvation
 of men, may the Lord rebuke and forgive me, and "let the righteous
 smite me, it shall be a kindness!" May the Head of the Church grant
 to you, and to all the other members of Synod, a disposition to hear,
 with patience and candor, a narration of my recent experience, in
 which perhaps you <i>may</i> find things both "new and old."</p>

 <p>My sentiments in relation to the "Sabbath of the Lord our God," have
 undergone an important change; to which I now wish to call your
 attention. Our Confession of Faith, Catechisms, and Testimony, all
 teach that the first day of the week is, and has been ever since the
 resurrection of Christ, the Christian Sabbath. This doctrine
 <i>alone</i>, of all those contained in our Standards, though I did
 believe it till lately, I can no longer receive. As to the
 <i>manner</i> of sanctifying the Sabbath,
 <span class="pagenum">{17-7}</span>
 I believe all that you and I have always contended for; but, for the
 present, I am constrained to believe, that the seventh day of the
 week is the only weekly Sabbath that God has ever appointed.</p>

 <p>My attention was first called to this subject by Rev. W. M. Jones,
 Missionary of the Baptist Church, who has recently abandoned his
 earlier views and practice in regard to the Sabbath. He not only
 argued the question with me at length, but gave me some publications
 of the American Sabbath Tract Society, which, as they seemed to
 breathe a spirit of ardent piety and zeal for God's law, I read with
 attention. Both in my discussion with him, and in the reading of
 those tracts, I struggled with all my might to convince myself, from
 the Scriptures, of the divine appointment of the first-day, or
 Christian Sabbath. But though I did not then doubt it, I was
 astonished to find how hard it is to prove it.</p>

 <p>I searched all the books I could find, bearing on this question, and
 discovered, what I had never noticed before, that the early French
 and Genevan Reformers, with Calvin at their head, had taught the
 abrogation of the fourth commandment, as a ceremonial institution;
 and that they contended for a Sabbath, or stated day of worship,
 under the gospel, only as a wise and necessary human arrangement. I
 found that even Turretin, at a later period, had taught that the
 fourth commandment is <i>partly</i> ceremonial, and that it was
 necessary to change the Sabbath from the seventh day, in order to put
 a difference between Jews and Christians. I found also, in my books,
 quotations, containing similar sentiments, from the celebrated
 Augsburg Confession. The only authors I could find who had attempted
 to prove, from the Scriptures, that the Sabbath has been changed from
 the seventh to the first day of the week, by divine authority, were,
 Turretin, and the framers of our Standards. Those authors appeared to
 depend <i>mainly</i> for proof upon three texts of Scripture:&mdash;Acts
 20:7; 1&nbsp;Cor. 16:1, 2; and Rev. 1:10. When I came to examine these
 texts, I was surprised and mortified, to find that they contain
 neither the word "Sabbath," nor any other synonymous with it. True, I
 had always thought that the "Lord's day," Rev. 1:10, was the first
 day of the week; but my opponents contended that the terms refer more
 properly to the seventh, which God styles "my holy day," Is. 58:13;
 and when I remembered "his challenging a special propriety in the
 seventh," I could not well deny it. Moreover, I could not find a
 single passage asserting that the first is holier than any other day
 of the week, or that Christians were, in the Apostles' days, in the
 habit of holding religious meetings <i>regularly</i>
 <span class="pagenum">{17-8}</span>
 on that day. Neither could I discover that Christ or his Apostles had
 ever spoken, directly or indirectly, of keeping a day holy in honor
 of his resurrection; nor that that event, which is always held up as
 the occasion of the change of the Sabbath, is even once mentioned in
 connection with the first day, unless where it is recorded as a
 historical fact. On the other hand, I observed that Christ and his
 Apostles <i>were accustomed</i> to enter into the synagogue on the
 seventh day, or Sabbath, for public worship. Luke 4:16; Acts 17:2,
 and elsewhere.</p>

 <p>Thus, my dear brother, I saw at this critical moment all Scripture
 evidence forsaking me, while every inch of ground on which I could
 set my foot was trembling. It seemed as if the thunders of Sinai were
 uttering anew their awful threatenings, while the "still small voice"
 of "Him that dwelt in the bush" was whispering in my ears, "The
 <i>seventh</i> day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10. "I
 am Jehovah, I change not." Mal. 3:6. "Verily, I say unto you, till
 heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
 from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18. Still I hesitated.
 For a moment I thought of "going down to Egypt for help." The
 Fathers, thought I, have fixed the interpretation of these texts in
 favor of the observance of the first day. But immediately I heard a
 voice within me, saying, "Would you then observe a holy-day, whose
 appointment cannot be proved from the Bible, without the aid of human
 tradition? Could you admit the 'testimony of the Fathers,' to set
 aside one of the plainest injunctions of the moral law, that law that
 was written upon tables of stone, 'by the finger of God,' and styled,
 by way of preëminence, '<i>the</i> Testimony?'" No! I replied, with
 an involuntary shudder; and another flood of Scriptures came rushing
 in, like "deep waters," to the very soul. "The law of the Lord is
 perfect." Ps. 19:7. "Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven."
 Ps. 119:89. "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and
 thy law is the truth." Ps. 119:142. "All his commandments are sure;
 they stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and
 uprightness." Ps. 111:7, 8. "Think not that I am come to destroy the
 law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." Matt.
 5:17. "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea,
 we establish the law." Rom. 3:31. O my brother, "the word of God is
 quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword."</p>

 <p>You have now my reasons for embracing a doctrine which is confessedly
 at variance with our Standards. What I entreat of you is, that you
 will once more examine this subject
 <span class="pagenum">{17-9}</span>
 for yourself, and see whether those Standards are consistent,
 on this point, either with the Scriptures, or with themselves.</p>

 <p>You perhaps think that I have forsaken the "footsteps of the flock,"
 and that testimony which has been sealed with the blood of martyrs.
 But tell me candidly, was there ever a martyr who died in defense of
 the first-day Sabbath? Or, could <i>you</i>, my brother, collect from
 the Scriptures evidence of its divine appointment, clear enough to
 solace your soul in the midst of the flames? From my inmost soul I
 pity that Covenanter who may be called to testify, at the stake, to
 the change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the
 week. Remember, too, that I am now in the path that was trodden by
 the saints for more than four thousand years; and it is for
 <i>you</i> to show that that path was ever stopped up, unless by the
 presumption and inexcusable neglect of man. Truly, I am "compassed
 about by a great cloud of witnesses." I would follow the example of
 Jehovah himself, who "blessed the seventh day and sanctified it," and
 by whom "the Sabbath was made for man;" the example of Adam, Enoch,
 and Noah; of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve patriarchs; of
 Moses, Aaron, and those millions of Pilgrim Covenanters who united in
 its observance in the wilderness; the example of Samuel, David, and a
 host of other prophets; of Jesus Christ, our Divine Mediator, and
 "Lord of the Sabbath;" and of the Apostles of our Lord, together with
 the churches established and watered by them;&mdash;in one word, the
 example of all the saints, from Adam to the last Apostle; all of whom
 kept and honored the seventh day as "the Sabbath of the Lord their
 God," and, having finished their course with joy, are entered into
 that heavenly rest, of which that Sabbath was, and still is, an
 emblem.</p>

 <p>I intend, if the Lord will, to be present at the next meeting of our
 Synod, and meet my brethren face to face. I expect, of course,
 nothing less than to be excluded from the privileges of the church;
 but I rejoice that I have learned to respect the discipline of the
 Lord's house. I desire, therefore, with a willing heart to approach
 the altar, and, if the Head of the Church require it, to be "offered
 upon the sacrifice and service of your faith," that God may be
 glorified in my salvation, and not in my destruction. God forbid,
 that either prejudice, willful ignorance, passion, or personal
 resentment, should fan the flames of that altar!</p>

 <p>In conclusion, rest assured of my continued and unabated attachment
 to the cause of the Reformation, in general, and to the interests of
 the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in particular; and allow me to
 repeat what I have already intimated,
 <span class="pagenum">{17-10}</span>
 that with every other doctrine contained in our Standards I am, so
 far as I understand my profession, entirely satisfied; nor have I
 abandoned <i>this one</i>, but from a firm conviction that it is not
 taught in God's Word. I know well, that trials sore and many await
 me. God doth know, that my heart delighteth not in contention; but,
 my brother, have we not all "entered into a curse, and into an oath,
 to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses, the servant of God,
 and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our God?" Neh.
 10:29.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>On the 21st of April, 1819, I set sail, with my
family, from Port-au-Prince, bidding farewell to
Haïti and her children, whom perhaps we shall
never see again in this vale of tears. We arrived
at Boston, all in good health, on the first Sabbath
in May.</p>

<p>On the evening of Tuesday, May 22, the Synod
was convened in Philadelphia; and the next morning
I appeared and took my seat with the other
members.</p>

<p>After noon, the same day, Rev. David Scott
stated to Synod, that I had made known a change
of views in relation to the Sabbath, and moved that
a committee of three be appointed to confer with
me, and report what farther action should be taken
in the case.</p>

<p>While this motion was pending, I stated, in substance,
that, as I was alone in a Synod of more than
sixty members, without a single man to plead my
cause, I thought I had a right to <i>demand</i> that the
<span class="pagenum">{17-11}</span>
proceedings should be instituted in strict accordance
with the letter of the law. I was here interrupted
by the Moderator, who, having informed
me that I had no right to dictate to the Court the
method of proceeding with its own business, peremptorily
ordered me to take my seat. I obeyed, of
course, though I could not see what dictation there
was in demanding a legal trial, according to the
printed rules of Synod. The motion was carried,
and the committee appointed.</p>

<p>Next morning, May 24, I had a conference of
half an hour with this committee, and at noon another,
that lasted about the same time. Their principal
object seemed to be, to ascertain whether I
was ready to <i>recant</i>, and submit to censure for my
past errors, I assured them, that while I had not
the slightest wish to withdraw from the communion
of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, I adhered
to every word in my Circular, and must continue to
do so, till convinced of error by the infallible scriptures.
The committee quoted several texts, and
advised me to read several authors, after which our
conference was closed.</p>

<p>After noon they presented their report, recommending
that the following Libel be preferred
against me by Synod:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small center">LIBEL PREFERRED AGAINST J. W. MORTON.</p>

 <p class="small">Whereas, denying that the first day of the week is the day on which
 the Christian Sabbath should be kept, is a heinous sin and scandal,
 contrary to the Word of God, and the Profession of the Reformed
 Presbyterian Church, founded thereon&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 20:7, "And upon
 the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break
 bread," &amp;c.; <i>Shorter Catechism</i>, "From the beginning of the
 world to the resurrection of Christ, God appointed the seventh day of
 the week to be the weekly Sabbath, and the first day of the week ever since,
 <span class="pagenum">{17-12}</span>
 to continue to the end of the world, which is the Christian
 Sabbath."</p>

 <p class="small">Yet true it is, that you, Rev. J. W. Morton, are guilty of the
 scandal above stated, in so far as you, the said J. W, Morton, at
 Port-au Prince, Haïti, 17th of January, 1849, did publish a Circular,
 in which you oppugned and denied that the first day of the week is
 the Christian Sabbath, which being found relevant, and proved against
 you, you ought to be proceeded against by the censures of the Lord's
 House.</p>

 <div class="sigbloc">
 <span class="right">A true copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By order of the Synod.<br />
 [Signed]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">John Wallace</span>, Ass't Clerk.</span>
 </div>

<p>After some discussion, the above Libel was decided
to be relevant, and the Clerk was directed to
serve a copy on me, with citation to appear for trial
the next day, after noon.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I went to my lodgings that evening with a heavy
heart, I was convinced, from the spirit of determined
opposition that had been manifested by many
of the brethren, when the Libel was under consideration,
that the majority had already determined
that I should not be permitted to "speak for myself."
True, I knew very well that the Apostle
Paul had once enjoyed this liberty, through the
cool civility of a Roman Governor, and afterwards,
through that of a Roman King; but I knew just <i>as</i>
well, that Felix and Aggrippa were heathens, while
my brethren are Christians; and that the dignity of
a court, composed of "worms of the dust," has been
much better understood, since the famous "Diet of
Worms," than ever before.</p>

<p>Still, I could not forbear asking myself, Why is
there now such bitter opposition to an Institution
that was once the delight of both God and man?
Why do men hate with such perfect hatred what
Jehovah made, and blessed, and sanctified, before
<span class="pagenum">{17-13}</span>
sin had entered into the world? Why should <i>this</i>
daughter of Innocence be spurned, from every door,
and loaded with the damning reproach of Judaism,
while her twin sister, Marriage, sucks the breasts,
and is dandled upon the knees of Orthodoxy? Why
should I be ranked with thieves and murderers, for
believing that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of
the Lord my God?" Bitter were the tears that
flowed; and more bitter still was the reflection, that
"when I wept, that was to my reproach."</p>

<p>I was hedged in round about, and what could I
do? I could only exclaim, with the "sweet Singer
of Israel," "Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord
God of Hosts, be ashamed for my sake; let not
those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O
God of Israel. Because for thy sake I have borne
reproach; shame hath covered my face. I am become
a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien
unto my mother's children. For the zeal of thy
house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them
that reproached thee are fallen upon me." Never
shall I forget the sensation experienced while the
last sentence was passing through my mind: "<i>And
the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen
upon me</i>." I know not how often, during that night,
I repeated these words, and compared them with
the exhortation of the Apostle: "Let us go forth
therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
reproach." These were the comforts, that, "in the
multitude of my thoughts within me," then delighted
my soul. I was about to go forth "without the
camp;" and it was indeed refreshing, in that hour
of trial, to believe, that I was bearing a portion of
the same burden that had once bowed down the
"Man of Sorrows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-14}</span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>My trial came on after noon, May 25th. The
following extract from the published Minutes of
Synod is, I believe, a correct, and sufficiently full,
account of the final issue; only it makes no mention
of the fact that I protested against the proceedings,
and appealed to the head of the Church, for reasons
to be given in afterwards. Why this fact was not
recorded, I have not been able to ascertain.</p>

 <p class="small center">EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF SYNOD.</p>

 <div class="small">

 <p>Order of the day, viz., the case of Mr. Morton, called for. The libel
 was then read by the Clerk; when Mr. Morton having, in reply to the
 Moderator, answered that he was prepared for trial, the substance of
 the libel was again stated in his hearing. Mr. Morton was then called
 upon, according to the rule provided for in such cases, either to
 confess the charge or put himself upon his trial. Mr. Morton in
 return acknowledged that he had denied that the day commonly called
 the Christian Sabbath is so by Divine appointment, and then proceeded
 to plead the irrelevancy of the charge by endeavoring to prove the
 perpetuity of the law for the observance of the seventh day. While so
 doing, he was arrested by the Moderator, who informed him that the
 charge contained in the libel was such that Mr. Morton could only
 prove its irrelevancy to censure by proving that the appropriation of
 the first day of the week, known as the Christian Sabbath, to secular
 employments, or teaching so to do, is not relevant to censure, which
 attempt the Moderator would consider disorderly, and would not allow.</p>

 <p>From this decision J. M. Willson appealed, when the Moderator's
 decision was unanimously sustained. Upon this Mr. Morton declined the
 authority of the court.</p>

 <p><i>Resolved</i>, That Mr. Morton's appointment as missionary to Haïti
 be revoked.</p>

 <p><i>Resolved</i>, That inasmuch as Mr. Morton has now publicly
 declined the authority of this court, he be suspended from the
 <span class="pagenum">{17-15}</span>
 exercise of the Christian ministry, and from the privileges of
 the Reformed Presbyterian Church.</p>

 <p>The Moderator then publicly pronounced the sentence of suspension on
 Mr. Morton, agreeably to the above resolution.</p>

 </div>

<p>Not long afterwards I presented to the Moderator
the following Reasons of Protest and Appeal,
with a request that he would allow them to be laid
before the court, which he utterly refused to do.</p>

 <p class="center small">REASONS OF PROTEST AND APPEAL.</p>

 <div class="small">

 <p>I do respectfully protest against the action of Synod in my case, on
 the 24th of the present month, and appeal therefrom to the Lord Jesus
 Christ, the King and Head of the Church, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

 <p>1st. Because I was not allowed to prove the irrelevancy of the charge
 made against me, by an appeal to the Bible, "the only rule of faith
 and manners."</p>

 <p>2nd. Because I believe that the statements, on the subject of the
 Sabbath, set forth in our subordinate standards, are inconsistent
 with one another, and in part contrary to the Word of God: yet it was
 by these unscriptural portions, that I was tried and condemned.</p>

 <p>Brethren, I entertain no hard feelings towards you. My daily prayer
 to God is, that you may be saved, and led into all truth. I did hope
 that you would hear and consider the claims of the Lord's holy
 Sabbath, when presented in a mild and affectionate manner. But either
 I have failed to present the question with sufficient tenderness, or
 you have determined to avoid all discussion in regard to it.</p>

 <p>It grieves me to the soul to bid you farewell. Both God and man will
 bear witness, in the day of final reckoning, that you have trampled
 down, by the resistless force of an overwhelming majority, one who
 was endeavoring with both hands to hold up the standard of the great
 Covenant God of our fathers. But though for the present cast down, I
 am not dismayed. The Sabbath of the Lord God is a richer treasure
 than the richest you can either give or take away. "Rejoice not
 against me, O mine enemy; when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in
 darkness, the Lord will be a light unto me. I will bear the
 indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he
 plead my cause, and execute judgment
 <span class="pagenum">{17-16}</span>
 for me; he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
 his righteousness."</p>

 <p>Brethren, I shall meet you before the judgment seat of Christ, on
 that day when he shall come "with ten thousand of his saints."
 "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they
 also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
 because of him. Even so, amen."</p>

<p class="small center">REFLECTIONS.</p>

<p>I did believe, and believe yet, that, had I been
sustained by twenty ministers and as many congregations,
I should have had leave to defend myself
to my heart's content. But it was very evident to
the Synod, that I stood alone. They knew that I
could do them no harm, by fomenting discord; and&mdash;may
I not add?&mdash;they knew that I was not the
man to be found employed in such a work. The
only loss they could sustain, in cutting me off, with
all my adherents, was that of two adults and as
many little children. Indeed, many of the members
<i>seemed</i> to regret the <i>trouble</i> far more than the <i>necessity</i>
of executing the law; and one aged father has
remarked to me since, that till then he never witnessed
a trial, before a church court, in which <i>there
was not one atom of mercy</i>.</p>

<p>Now, is there not a reason for all this? Unquestionably
there is. The loose and unpresbyterial
doctrine, that a majority has a right to determine
what <i>is</i>, and what <i>is not</i> truth, and that the greater
the majority in favor of any dogma, the more firmly
its truth is established, has leavened, sadly and extensively,
even the Reformed Presbyterian Church.
This is the reason why one who represents a lean
minority cannot be heard, even in defense of ecclesiastical
life. The majority have said, that the first
day is the Sabbath, and who dare call in question
<span class="pagenum">{17-17}</span>
the assertion? A man may be denounced as a covenant-breaker;
yet, because he belongs to a small
minority, he may not attempt to prove his innocence
of the crime. Thus the right of the minority to
vindicate themselves from the Scriptures, in defense
of which many of the old Covenanters bled, is practically
denied by their descendants. "O Lord,
how long!"</p>

<p>Brethren, are you really so wedded to this <i>majority
principle</i>? Know, then, that <i>God is a majority</i>;
and that those that are with <i>me</i> are more than
those that are with <i>you</i>. God's testimony is worth
more than that of all men. What though millions
<i>have</i> affirmed, that the seventh day is <span class="smcap">not</span> the Sabbath?
<i>He</i> hath left us this imperishable testimony:
"The seventh day <span class="smcap">is</span> the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God." And this is the testimony of the <i>greatest
majority</i> that ever gave utterance to truth. But
God hath not left himself without other witnesses.
Where are those myriads of angels who were present
when "the Sabbath was made for man?"
Where are those "morning stars" who "sang together,"
and those "sons of God" who "shouted
for joy," when our Father "laid the foundations of
the earth?" They are not <i>now</i> present with us,
'tis true, to bear their testimony; but they <i>will be</i>
present, when you and I shall appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, to hear the decision of this
controversy. And do you think that you will then
dare, on the authority of what is said in Acts 20:7,
to lift up your hands, and swear "by Him that liveth
forever and ever," that the Sabbath has been
"changed into the first day of the week"&mdash;and
that, too, in presence of those who saw the foundations
of the ancient Sabbath, like those of the earth
itself, laid and balanced upon God's eternal decree,
and inwrought with the very stones of "the everlasting
<span class="pagenum">{17-18}</span>
hills?" No! No!! The Sabbath was one
of those <i>pillars</i> of the ancient earth, which Christ,
the Mediator, seized with the hand of his omnipotence,
and bare up, when "the earth and all its inhabitants"
were sinking into nothing. I repeat it&mdash;and
who dare gainsay it?&mdash;the Lord of Hosts is
an overwhelming <i>majority</i>!</p>

<p>But this is not all. There is, indeed, no <i>greater</i>
witness than these; but there is <i>other</i> witness. Look
into your own hearts, ye children of God, redeemed
by the blood of the Lamb, and you will find recorded
there: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work."
"For this is the covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord; I
will put <i>my laws</i> into their mind, and write them in
their hearts." Here there is not the least hint of
any exception. The same moral law that was written
"with the finger of God," on tables of stone, is
now written "by the Spirit of the living God," on
the fleshly tables of <i>your</i> hearts. Yes, brethren,
turn your eyes inward, and you will read, "The
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in
it thou shalt not do any work." If you say, We
have sought this law, but find it not&mdash;O brethren,
you have not "sought it carefully with tears." It
is hidden among the rubbish, and you will never
find it, till that be removed. But I speak what I do
know, when I assure you, that it <i>is</i> recorded there;
and in the day of the Lord Jesus, if not sooner, you
will find it there, to your unspeakable joy and satisfaction.
O Lord, "open thou our eyes, that we
may behold wondrous things out of thy law."</p>

<h3>PART II.<br /><br />
DIVINE APPOINTMENT OF THE SEVENTH DAY</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>The following pages, containing a brief discussion
of a small but intensely interesting portion of the
Sabbath controversy, are designed especially for the
perusal of those Christians, styled orthodox, who do
not keep holy the seventh day of the week.</p>

<p>Dear brethren, this is a subject of fearful importance.
If the views herein advocated are correct,
<i>you</i> are guilty both of breaking and of teaching men
to break one of God's holy commandments; if they
are incorrect, I am no less guilty. Need I say any
thing more to convince you that you ought to give
this subject a candid and prayerful examination?
"Ye are the light of the world;" take heed, brethren,
that your light be not darkness! You know&mdash;you
cannot but know&mdash;that there is much, <i>very much</i>,
said in the Bible about the Sabbath, and that men
are very often commanded to keep it holy. You
must know, also, that God has said in the fourth commandment,
"The <i>seventh day</i> is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work;"
and that, for more than four thousand years, no other
day of the week ever claimed to be holy. Moreover,
you cannot but know, if you have read the Bible
carefully, that the first day of the week, which
you call "the Christian Sabbath," is <i>very seldom</i>
mentioned; that there are only six passages in which
<span class="pagenum">{17-20}</span>
the name occurs, and that four of these may be viewed
as one, being the records of the same events,
by different Evangelists; and how can you have
failed to notice the fact, that in not one of these
six passages are we, or any of our fellow-creatures,
commanded to keep the first day holy? Yet you
are convinced that the first day of the week is <i>the
very Sabbath-day</i>, while among all those Scripture
commands, before referred to, you find nothing
to sustain the claims of the seventh. O brethren,
you "put darkness for light, and light for darkness."
Let us bow before the mercy-seat of Him who is
the Author of life and light, and, renewing our personal
covenant with him, plead his precious promise:
"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples
indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free."</p>

<p>I shall endeavor, in the following pages, to establish
the truth of the following proposition:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>That the seventh day of the week is the only weekly
Sabbath of God's appointment.</i></p>

<p>I intend to present and enforce <i>four reasons</i> for
believing this proposition:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;Because the original Sabbath law requires
the sanctification of no other day.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Because Adam and all his posterity have
solemnly covenanted to keep holy the seventh day.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Because Christ and his Apostles honored
this day; and did not intimate that it would ever
cease to be the Sabbath, but the contrary.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;Because God has never blessed and sanctified
any day of the week but the seventh.</p>

<p>As the discussion is limited by design to a narrow
<span class="pagenum">{17-21}</span>
range, you will please to bear in mind, that the
following points are assumed as true:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;The Sabbath was instituted before the fall
of man.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Adam represented all his posterity in the
covenant of works.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;The Sabbath law is perpetual, "binding
all men in all ages."</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;The seventh day was the <i>only</i> weekly
Sabbath for at least four thousand years.</p>

<p>Lord, sanctify us by thy truth. May the Holy
Ghost, the Comforter, whom thou sendest in the
name of thy Son our Lord, abide in us and preside
in this controversy. May he teach us all things, and
bring all things to our remembrance. May all bitterness,
and wrath, and malice, and evil-speaking,
be far from us; and may we love one another
with pure hearts fervently&mdash;for Christ's sake. Amen.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="small"><i>First Reason.</i></span></h4>

<p class="gap-above center small">PROPOSITION.</p>

<p>That the seventh day of the week is the only
weekly sabbath of God's appointment.</p>

<p class="gap-above">My first reason for believing this proposition is,
That the original Sabbath law, referred to in Genesis
2:2, 3, and embodied in Exodus 20:8-11, requires
the sanctification of no other day.</p>

 <p class="small">Genesis 2:2, 3.&mdash;"And on the seventh day (<i>on day the seventh</i>)
 God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh
 day (<i>on day the seventh</i>) from all his
 <span class="pagenum">{17-22}</span>
 work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh <span
 class="smcap">day</span> (<i>the day the seventh</i>,) and sanctified
 it: because that in <span class="smcap">it</span> he had rested from
 all his work which God created and made."</p>

 <p class="small">Exodus 20:8, 11.&mdash;"Remember the Sabbath-<span class="smcap">day</span>, (<i>the day of
 the rest, or Sabbath</i>,) to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
 labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day (<i>day the
 seventh</i>) is the Sabbath (<i>rest</i>) of the Lord thy God: <i>in
 it</i> thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor
 thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle,
 nor thy stranger that <i>is</i> within thy gates: for in six days the
 Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them <i>is</i>,
 and rested the seventh day (<i>on day the seventh</i>;) wherefore the
 Lord blessed the Sabbath-<span class="smcap">day</span> (<i>the day of the rest, or
 Sabbath</i>,) and hallowed <span class="smcap">it</span>."</p>

<p>The only object, direct or indirect, of this commandment,
is "<i>the day</i>." What are we commanded
to remember? "The day." What are we required
to keep holy? "The day." What did the
Lord bless and hallow? "The day." In what are
we forbidden to work? In "the day," Now let us
inquire&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What day? <i>Not</i> the day of Adam's fall; nor
the day Noah went into the ark; nor the day of the
overthrow of Sodom; nor the day of the Exodus;
nor the day of the Provocation; nor the day of the
removal of the ark; nor the day of Christ's birth;
nor the day of his crucifixion; nor the day of his
resurrection; nor the day of his ascension; nor the
day of judgment. It may be, and certainly is, proper,
that we should remember all these; but we
are not told to do so in this commandment. Neither
is it some one day of the week, but no one in particular;
for how could we remember "<i>the</i> day," that
is no day in particular?&mdash;how could we keep holy
"<i>the</i> day" that has not been specified?&mdash;and how
could we say that God had blessed and hallowed
"<i>the</i> day," that was no one day more than another?
What day, then? God says, Remember <i>the Sabbath-day</i>,
or <i>the day of the Sabbath</i>; Keep holy <i>the
<span class="pagenum">{17-23}</span>
day of the Sabbath</i>; The Lord blessed and hallowed <i>the
day of the Sabbath</i>. He also says, <i>The seventh day</i>
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; <i>in it</i> thou shalt
not do any work. This day, therefore, is "the
seventh day," or "the day of the Sabbath."</p>

<p>2. What Sabbath? Not "<i>a</i> Sabbath," or any
Sabbath that man may invent, or that God may
hereafter keep; for that would be "some Sabbath,"
but no one in particular. Not some institution yet
undetermined, that God may require man to observe
weekly; for the command is not, "Remember
the Sabbath institution," but, "Remember the
<i>day</i> of the Sabbath;" not, "Keep holy the Sabbath
institution," but, "Keep holy the <i>day</i> of the Sabbath."
The Lord did not bless and hallow "the
Sabbath institution," but "the <i>day</i> of the Sabbath."
We are not forbidden to do work in "the Sabbath
institution," but in "the <i>seventh day</i>." In fact, the
phrase "the Sabbath," in this commandment, means
neither more nor less than "the rest." It is not <i>here</i>
the name of any institution at all, though it is often
thus used in other parts of the Bible. Hence, this
Sabbath is "the Sabbath or rest of the Lord thy
God."</p>

<p>3. Which day of the week is "the day of the Sabbath?"
No other than that day on which the Lord
rested; for the command refers to God's Sabbath,
On which day of the week did he rest? "And he
rested on the seventh day." Genesis 2:2. Therefore,
"the day of the Sabbath" is the same day of
the week on which God rested from the work of
creation; and as he rested on the seventh day of
the first week, and on no other, the seventh and no
other day of every other week must be the only "day
of the Sabbath."</p>

<p>Let it be particularly observed, that God does not
say, Remember the Sabbath, or, Remember the Sabbatic
<span class="pagenum">{17-24}</span>
institution, though this is necessarily implied
in the command; but, Remember "the day of the
Sabbath"&mdash;the day on which I have ordained that
the Sabbatic institution be observed. As if he had
said, There is little danger, <i>comparatively</i>, that you
will forget the fact of my having kept Sabbath; nor
is it likely that you will altogether neglect to observe
<i>some day</i> of rest from your arduous toils, for
you will be driven to this by the ever returning demands
of your exhausted bodies; but you are, and
always will be, in especial danger of forgetting the
proper day of the week for honoring me in my own
institution. Satan, who takes infinite delight in all
kinds of "will-worship," while he hates with a perfect
hatred every act of strict obedience to my law,
will do all he can to persuade you that some other
day will do just as well, or even better. Remember,
therefore, the day of my Sabbath, and keep the
same day holy in every week; for&mdash;mark the reason&mdash;I
have myself rested on the seventh day, and
on that account I have blessed and sanctified that
and no other day of the week, that you may observe
it, and keep it holy, not because it is in itself better
than any other day, but because I have blessed and
sanctified it.</p>

<p>But you say that the phrase, "the Sabbath-day,"
or "the day of the Sabbath," does not mean any
particular day, but "one day in seven," or some one
of the days of the week. You alledge that "the day
of the Sabbath," like "the Pope of Rome," "the
Emperor of Russia," or "the King of Denmark,"
is a generic term, alike applicable to all the members
of the same class. The phrase, "the Emperor
of Russia," you say, refers alike to Peter, to Alexander,
and to Nicholas, though only one of them
could be Emperor at any given time; so "the day
of the Sabbath" refers alike to the seventh and to
<span class="pagenum">{17-25}</span>
the first day of the week, though there never was
but one Sabbath at any one time. This is a very
ingenious and plausible method of evading the force
of the Divine testimony; but, as the reasoning by
which it is sustained appears to be entirely sophistical,
I cannot but look upon the whole thing as a fabrication.
I believe that any man, possessing the requisite
qualifications, <i>may</i> become "Emperor of
Russia," but deny that any day but one <i>can</i> be the
day of God's Sabbath, inasmuch as God had never
kept, at that time, but one Sabbath, and that occupied
only one day. There is only one day of American
Independence; only one day of the Resurrection
of Christ; only one day of the birth of any
one man; and only one day of Judgment. And
why? Because American Independence was declared
on but one day; Christ rose on but one day;
the same man cannot be born on two different days;
and God hath appointed only one day in which he
will judge the world. Now, on the same principle,
there can be but one "day of the Sabbath" of the
Lord our God. If I should say that the day of
Christ's Resurrection is not any particular day of
the week, but only "one day in seven," you would
not hesitate to call me a fool, while my ignorance
would excite your deepest sympathy; but when
<i>you</i> say that "the day of the Sabbath" does not
mean that particular day on which the Lord's Sabbath
occurred, but only "one day in seven," you expect
me to receive your assertion as the infallible
teaching of superior wisdom. I cannot, however,
so receive it, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. If God had meant "one day in seven," he
would have said so. His first and great design, in
writing his law on tables of stone, was to be understood
by his creatures; but, for more than two thousand
years after he gave the law, no human being
<span class="pagenum">{17-26}</span>
ever suspected that "the day of the Sabbath" meant
anything else than the seventh day of the week, because
it was commonly known that that day alone
was in reality "the day of the Sabbath." Indeed,
this "one-day-in-seven" doctrine is known to have
been invented within a few hundred years, with the
pious design of accounting for a change of Sabbath,
without the necessity of repealing a portion of the
moral law. It is matter of great surprise, that those
pious theologians, who first substituted "one day in
seven" for "the day of the Sabbath," did not shudder
at the thought of presuming to mend the language
of the Holy Ghost. "The words of the Lord
are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of
earth, purified seven times." Ps. 12:6. Brethren,
are you prepared to enter into judgment, and answer
for the liberties you have taken with God's
word? In substituting the vague and indefinite expression,
"one day in seven," for the definite and
unequivocal terms, "the Sabbath-day," and "the
seventh day," you have as truly taken "away from
the words of the prophecy of this book," as if you
had blotted the fourth commandment from the Decalogue;
while your leading object has been, to
make way for the introduction of a new command
that, for aught the Scriptures teach, it never entered
into the heart of the Almighty to put into his law.
"A faithful witness will not lie," and when the
world asks, Which day of the seven hath God appointed
to be the weekly Sabbath? God expects
that you, as faithful witnesses, will not only "not
lie," but that you will not equivocate, or give with
the gospel trumpet "an uncertain sound." He does
not expect that you will quote a text from the Acts
of the Apostles, that says not one word about Sabbath-keeping,
to prove that the fourth commandment
enjoins the keeping holy of "one day in seven,"
but of "no day in particular."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-27}</span>
2. God never blessed "one day in seven," without
blessing a particular day. He either blessed
some definite object, or nothing. You <i>may</i> say, indeed,
without falsehood, that God blessed "one day
in seven;" but if you mean that this act of blessing
did not terminate on any particular day, you ought
to know, that you are asserting what is naturally impossible.
As well might you say of a band of robbers,
that they had killed "one man in seven," while
in reality they had killed no man in particular. No,
brethren, yourselves know very well, that God had
not blessed and sanctified any day but <i>the seventh of
the seven</i>, prior to the giving of the written law. You
know, that if God blessed any day of the week at
all, it was a definite day, distinct from all the other
days of the week. But this commandment says,
that "the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day." Therefore
the Sabbath-day must be a particular day of the
week. Therefore "the Sabbath-day" is not "one
day in seven," or an indefinite seventh part of time.
Therefore it is not "one day in seven" that we are
required to remember, and keep holy, and in which
we are forbidden to do any work; but "the seventh
day" of the week, which was then, is now,
and will be till the end of time, "the day of the
Sabbath" of the Lord our God.</p>

<p>3. No day of the week but the seventh was ever
called "the day of the Sabbath," either by God or
man, till long since the death of the last inspired
writer. Search both Testaments through and
through, and you will find no other day called "<i>the</i>
Sabbath," or even "<i>a</i> Sabbath," except the ceremonial
Sabbaths, with which, of course, we have nothing
to do in this controversy. And long after the
close of the canon of inspiration, the seventh day,
and no other, was still called "the Sabbath." If
you can prove that any one man, among the millions
<span class="pagenum">{17-28}</span>
of Adam's children, from the beginning of the world
till the <i>rise of Anti-Christ</i>, ever called the first day
of the week "<i>the Sabbath</i>," you will shed a light
upon this controversy, for which a host of able writers
have searched in vain.</p>

<p>But, farther; the first day of the week was not
observed by any of the children of men, <i>as a Sabbath</i>,
for three hundred years after the birth of
Christ. Do you ask proof? I refer you to Theodore
de Beza, who plainly says so. If you are not
satisfied with the witness, will you have the goodness
to prove the affirmative of the proposition?</p>

<p>I infer, therefore, that "the day of the Sabbath,"
or "the Sabbath-day," is the proper name of the
seventh day of the week, as much so as "the day
of Saturn;" and that to attach this proper name <i>now</i>
to some other day of the week, and to affirm that
God meant that other day, as much as he did the
seventh, when he wrote the law on tables of stone,
is as unreasonable as it is impious. If you say, that
when God speaks of "the Sabbath-day," he means
"one day in seven, but no day in particular," you
are as far from the truth as if you said that, when he
speaks of Moses, he does not mean any particular
man, but "some one of the Israelites." Moses
<i>was</i> one of the Israelites, just as the Sabbath-day <i>is</i>
one day in seven. But when God says Moses, he
means Moses the son of Amram; and when he says
"the Sabbath-day," he means the seventh day of
the week. You <i>may</i> give different names to the
same object, without interfering with its identity;
but to apply the same name to two different objects,
and then to affirm that these two objects are identically
the same, so that what is predicated of the one
must be true of the other, is as though a navigator
should discover an island in the Southern Ocean, and
call it "England," and then affirm that the late
<span class="pagenum">{17-29}</span>
work of Mr. Macaulay, entitled "The History of
England," is a veritable and authentic history of his
newly-discovered empire. Which would you wonder
at most, the stupidity or the effrontery of that
navigator?</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without reminding you
that, in attempting to refute the above reasoning,
the main thing you will have to show is, that "the
Sabbath-day," or "the day of the Sabbath," is an
indefinite or general expression, applicable alike to
at least two different days of the week, and that it
is used indefinitely in this commandment. If it has
been proved, that "the day of the Sabbath" refers,
and can refer, <i>only</i> to the seventh day of the week,
then it is true, and will remain forever true, that
the original Sabbath law requires the sanctification
of no other day. This is the truth which I undertook
to exhibit in this chapter, and is my first reason
for believing the proposition under consideration.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="small"><i>Second Reason.</i></span></h4>

<p>My second reason for believing this proposition
is, That Adam and all his posterity have solemnly
covenanted to keep holy the seventh day.</p>

 <p class="small">Genesis 2:15-17&mdash;"And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
 Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it. And the Lord God
 commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest
 freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
 shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
 shalt surely die."</p>

 <p class="small">Romans 5:12, 19&mdash;"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered
 <span class="pagenum">{17-30}</span>
 into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon
 all men, for that all have sinned." "For as by one man's disobedience
 many were made sinners; so by the obedience of
 one many shall be made righteous."</p>

 <p class="small">Galatians 3:10&mdash;"For as many as are of the works of the law, are
 under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
 continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
 to do them."</p>

<p>On these passages it may be remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of
works, by which he bound him, <i>and all his posterity</i>
to personal, exact, <i>entire</i>, and <i>perpetual</i> obedience."</p>

<p>2. "This law, after his fall, continued to be <i>a perfect
rule of righteousness</i>; and, <i>as such</i>, was delivered
by God upon Mount Sinai in ten commandments,
and written in two tables." Therefore, the fourth
commandment and the Sabbath law of the covenant
of works are <i>one and the same law</i>; and all believers
in Christ are now bound by this law, <i>as a rule of
life</i>, to remember and keep holy the <i>same Sabbath-day</i>
that Adam and all his posterity covenanted to
remember and keep holy.</p>

<p>3. You admit that Adam, <i>and all his posterity</i>,
pledged themselves to keep holy the seventh day of
every week, <i>and no other</i>. Therefore, <i>we</i> are all born
under a solemn obligation, our own obligation in
Adam, to keep holy that same seventh day of every
week as long as we remain on earth: "<i>Neither doth
Christ in the gospel any way dissolve but much
strengthen this obligation</i>."</p>

<p>4. It is now too late to alter the covenant of
works, by substituting some other day of the week
for the seventh, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;Because the whole transaction was finished,
in the person of our representative, nearly six
thousand years ago. The covenant was made, the
obligation assumed, the deed of transgression consummated,
<span class="pagenum">{17-31}</span>
the curse pronounced, and the bitter
<i>death</i> experienced, in <i>kind</i>, though not <i>in degree</i>,
and all this before the first revelation of the mercy
of God in Christ. We are, therefore, all of us, the
very moment we are born, accursed of God, for not
having kept holy the seventh day of the week, according
to our covenant. And all who are not redeemed
therefrom by Christ, remain forever under
this curse. From which it is plain, that to substitute
some other day for the seventh, since the fall
of man, is as impossible as it would be to substitute
<i>some other tree</i> for the "tree of knowledge." To
all who admit that God made a covenant of works
with all mankind <i>in Adam</i>, these truths ought to be
self-evident. Brethren, <i>we</i> acknowledge that we are
all guilty before God of having eaten of the fruit of
the tree of knowledge, while we disclaim <i>any guilt
whatever</i> in regard to the fruit of every other tree;
so are we guilty of violating the rest of the seventh
day of the week, while we are not by nature guilty
of polluting any other day.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Because such substitution would destroy
an integral part of the moral law. The law written
on the heart of man said nothing about keeping holy
any other day than the seventh; for all admit that,
had Adam not fallen, there never would have been
any other holy day. If, then, this law does <i>not now</i>
require the sanctification of the seventh day, <i>the
fourth commandment must have been annihilated</i>; and
if another day is <i>now</i> the Sabbath, a new commandment,
requiring <i>for a new reason</i> the sanctification of
a different day, must have been substituted in its
place. But this new law can be <i>no part of the moral
law</i>, because it was <i>not written on man's heart</i>, nor
did any human being know of its existence till thousands
of God's people had been taken home to glory.
God gave to Adam <i>free permission</i> to labor and do
<span class="pagenum">{17-32}</span>
work on every day but the seventh, and he, as a free
moral agent, accepted the proffered boon. Therefore,
to labor on any one of the first six days of the
week is, under the covenant of works, <i>as innocent in
itself</i> as to pray to the Creator of the Universe. It
is as much a natural and inalienable right, as "life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Now, if there
is a law that requires the keeping holy of some other
day, it must have its origin in the new-covenant
grace of God; and if that other day, and not the
seventh, is <i>now</i> the Sabbath, men are <i>now</i> no more
under a <i>natural</i> obligation to keep a Sabbath than
to be baptized, or to celebrate the Lord's Supper.
The obligation to keep it <i>must</i>, on your principle,
grow out of their new-covenant relation to God in
Christ.</p>

<p>Let us now look for a moment at the consequences
flowing from the doctrine, that some other day&mdash;the
first, for example&mdash;has been substituted for the seventh.
"Try the spirits." "By their fruits ye shall
know them."</p>

<p>1. If this doctrine be true, the doctrine <i>that
Adam represented all his posterity, must be false</i>; for,
if Adam covenanted, as you admit he did, to keep
holy the seventh day of every week, and <i>we</i> are not
bound to do so, he certainly did not represent us,
neither in that nor in any other part of the covenant;
for, if we did not promise in Adam to keep holy the
Sabbath-day, we did not promise to keep any thing
else.</p>

<p>2. If this doctrine be true, <i>there is now no such
thing as original sin</i>. This follows as a matter of
course; for, if Adam did not represent us, we are
not <i>born sinners</i>. The fact might be proved in another
way, but this is enough.</p>

<p>3. If this doctrine be true, and the law of the new
Sabbath bind "all men," as you say it does, it must
<span class="pagenum">{17-33}</span>
bind <i>the heathen</i>, who are a part of "all men." But
if there is a new Sabbath instituted, it can only be
made known through the written word of God, of
which the heathen <i>can know nothing</i>. This new Sabbath
has never been made known to them, nor to
any of their ancestors. Nevertheless, you say that
they are bound to observe it, <i>according to the written
word</i>, and that they shall be punished to all eternity
for breaking it; which is contrary to the teaching
of the Apostle, (Rom. 2:12,) that the heathen
shall be judged and condemned, not by the written
word, but by <i>the law of nature</i>, which you know can
reveal no Sabbath but that of the seventh day; for
Adam, who understood the law of nature better
than any other mere man, never thought of keeping
holy any other day. And, moreover, the heathen
have, on your principle, only nine commandments
to obey or disobey; for they are under the law of
nature, which says, "Keep holy the seventh day:"
but you say that God does not <i>now</i> require this:
therefore they are released from the obligation.
And, what is stranger still, the heathen have no
means of knowing that to keep the seventh day <i>is a
work of supererogation</i>. These are <i>a few</i> of the consequences
of your doctrine of a change of Sabbath.
What must be the character of that tree which yields
such fruits!</p>

<p>Let us now attend for a moment to your objections.</p>

<p>Do you say, Those who believe in Christ are redeemed,
not only from the curse of the Sabbath law,
but also from the obligation to obey it in future? If
so, who can tell but we are redeemed from <i>every
other</i> moral obligation?</p>

<p>Or, do you alledge, that Christ makes a new contract
with the sinner, saying, If you keep holy the
first day, I will release you from the obligation to
<span class="pagenum">{17-34}</span>
sanctify the seventh? "Do we then make void the
law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish
the law," Rom. 3:31. But perhaps you say, To
change the Sabbath from one day to another is not
to make void the law; it is only to vary its application.
I reply, It <i>is</i> to make void, to <i>annul</i>, to
<i>annihilate</i>, one tenth part of that law that God wrote
on Adam's heart; for, as has been shown already,
that law required him to keep no day holy but the
seventh.</p>

<p>Or, do you plead that, as God <i>has</i> substituted the
Lord Jesus Christ for the sinner, without violating
the moral law, so he <i>may</i> have substituted some
other day for the seventh? I reply, The cases are
not parallel; for&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The substitution of Christ does not render a
change of any part of the law necessary; but the
other does. Christ "came not to destroy" the law,
but to fulfill it; and in fulfilling it, he honored the
seventh day: but the substitution of some other day
for the seventh, had it taken place before Christ
came, would have released him, as well as us, from
the obligation to obey a part of the law of the covenant
of works.</p>

<p>2. A change of Sabbath is not, like the substitution
of Christ, <i>necessary</i> to the salvation of sinners;
for God had saved thousands before this change is
alledged to have taken place.</p>

<p>3. The substitution of Christ changes the moral
condition <i>of the church only</i>; but the change of
Sabbath would affect the moral relations of all men;
for the Sabbath was made, not for the church, but
"for man."</p>

<p>4. The evangelical doctrine of the substitutionary
sacrifice of Christ, of itself, proves the impossibility
of a change of Sabbath. All evangelical
Christians hold, that believers are delivered, through
<span class="pagenum">{17-35}</span>
Christ, from the <i>curse</i> of the law&mdash;the law of the
covenant of works&mdash;<i>but not from the obligation to
obey it</i>. If, therefore, that law required <i>Adam and
his posterity</i> to keep holy the seventh day of the
week, Christ has never redeemed them from the obligation
to render "<i>exact obedience</i>," in this particular,
as in every other.</p>

<p>Do you plead, as a last resort, that, as the command
not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge
has passed away, so it may be with the law of the
seventh-day Sabbath? I reply, The cases are not
parallel; for that command never was a part of the
moral law. It was never written, either on man's
heart, or on tables of stone; but this was. Besides,
the tree of knowledge has been destroyed from the
face of the earth, so that to eat of its fruit is now
impossible; but the seventh day will continue to
return "while the earth remaineth."</p>

<p>Brethren, you bewilder yourselves and others, by
adopting, as a moral axiom, the false principle, that
whatever is in its nature positive, is <i>for that reason</i>,
changeable. There is no principle more deadly
than this. Do you not know, that all our hopes, as
Christians, for time and for eternity, are suspended
on the <i>immutability</i> of that <i>positive arrangement</i> between
the Father and the Son, which we call the
covenant of grace? Are not the decrees of God
all <i>positive</i>, yet, at the same time, immutable? So,
also, the <i>Sabbath law</i>, though in its nature positive,
has been made unchangeable, by a solemn covenant
arrangement, "in which it was impossible for God
to lie." If God had not made the law, requiring the
sanctification of the seventh day, an essential part of
the covenant of works, your doctrine of a change of
Sabbath would not be so preposterous. As it is, how
can serious, thinking men, help viewing it as a monstrous
and impious absurdity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-36}</span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="small"><i>Third Reason.</i></span></h4>

<p>My third reason for believing this proposition is,
That Christ and his Apostles honored this day; and
did not intimate that it would ever cease to be the
Sabbath, but the contrary.</p>

<p>1. Christ honored this day.</p>

 <p class="small">Luke 4:16&mdash;"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up:
 and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the
 Sabbath-day, and stood up for to read."</p>

 <p class="small">Luke 4:30, 31; (See also Mark 1:21)&mdash;"But he, passing through the
 midst of them, went his way, and came down to Capernaum, a city of
 Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath-days."</p>

 <p class="small">Luke 13:10&mdash;"And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the
 Sabbath."</p>

 <p class="small">Mark 3:1, 2&mdash;"And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was
 a man there which had a withered hand. And they watched him whether
 he would heal him on the Sabbath-day."</p>

 <p class="small">Mark 6:2&mdash;"And when the Sabbath-day was come, he began to teach in
 the synagogue."</p>

<p>2. The Apostles honored this day. Read carefully
the following passages and their contexts.</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 13:14&mdash;"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch
 in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and sat
 down."</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 13:44&mdash;"And the next Sabbath-day came almost the whole city
 together to hear the word of God." (That is, to hear Paul and
 Barnabas preach.)</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 14:1&mdash;"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they (Paul and
 Barnabas) went both together into the synagogue
 <span class="pagenum">{17-37}</span>
 of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude, both of the
 Jews, and also of the Greeks, believed."</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 16:23&mdash;"And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river
 side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
 unto the women which resorted thither."</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 17:2&mdash;"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
 Sabbath-days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures."</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 18:4&mdash;"And he (Paul) reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath,
 and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."</p>

<p>Brethren, if you produce one solitary apostolic
example of unnecessary labor performed on the
seventh day, I will at once give up the argument in
its favor.</p>

<p>3. Neither Christ nor his Apostles intimated that
the seventh day would cease to be the Sabbath.</p>

<p>This being a negative assertion, I am not bound
to prove it, of course. If you assert that they did,
I demand the proof of it.</p>

<p>4. Christ has very plainly intimated the contrary.</p>

 <p class="small">Matthew 24:20&mdash;"But pray ye that your flight be not in winter,
 neither on the Sabbath-day."</p>

<p>The "flight" here spoken of was to take place
about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem; and
the Saviour admonishes his disciples to pray that it
might not happen on the Sabbath-day. Now, if he
knew that the Sabbath-day would be changed into
the "Lord's day," forty years before the event he
had just alluded to, why did he speak of it as a
thing that would be then in existence? Many are
the efforts that have been made to evade the force of
the argument from this text; but they are all unavailing.</p>

 <p class="small">Matthew 5:17, 19&mdash;"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or
 the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I
 say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass,
 <span class="pagenum">{17-38}</span>
 one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
 fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
 commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the
 kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
 shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>It is almost universally admitted, that the Saviour,
in these verses, refers principally to the ten commandments,
which were then, as now, called, by way
of preëminence, "<i>the</i> law." That he may have referred
also to the ceremonial code, which he came
to fulfill, we do not deny. But this has nothing to do
with our present purpose.</p>

<p>That the fourth commandment enjoins the sanctification
of the seventh day of the week, no man in
his senses denies. But you alledge that that part
of it has been taken away, so that it does not now
bind us.</p>

<p>Now, in making this assertion, you either affirm
what is positively denied in the above quotation, or
you make this commandment at least <i>partly</i> ceremonial,
and <i>peculiar to the Jews</i>. This will appear
evident from the following considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;The command to keep holy the seventh
day of the week, is far more than "one jot or one
tittle" of this law. It could be no less, but it is
much more. Indeed, it is very certain, that Adam
considered it a very important part of the law; and
so did Christ, when he uttered those words, for he
kept the Sabbath as devoutly as Adam ever did.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Heaven and earth have not yet passed
away; but you say that this seventh-day law has;
therefore, much more than "one jot or one tittle"
has passed from the law&mdash;which is contrary to
Christ's assertion.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;If you say that Christ has fulfilled this
law, and so taken it away, you make it a ceremony,
like the Passover. You know that Christ never fulfilled,
<span class="pagenum">{17-39}</span>
<i>so as to take away</i>, any law but those that he
"nailed to his cross," and that he never nailed to
his cross any law that bindeth "all men in all ages."
If, then, the law requiring the sanctification of the
seventh day of the week has been nailed to the cross
of Christ, it must have been a ceremony peculiar to
the Jews, and to which the Gentiles were never
bound. Was Adam a Jew? Was Enoch a Jew?
Were Noah and his sons Jews? But these all kept
the seventh day, <i>and no other</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Brethren, it has been proved, in the first chapter
of this treatise, that the fourth commandment requires
simply the observance of the seventh day of
the week. I will not repeat what is there said. I
now ask you, as candid inquirers after truth, to place
this commandment and our Saviour's declarations,
quoted above, side by side, and see if <i>your</i> conduct
is not at war with both. You neglect the only day
that God's law requires you to remember, while
Christ assures you, in the most solemn manner, that
"one jot or one tittle" shall in no wise pass from
the law, "till heaven and earth pass," or till time
shall be no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-40}</span>
There is a little commandment in that law that
says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Christ
says, that whosoever doeth and teacheth this commandment
"shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven." But this hath been my only crime. God
knows, and you know, that the only thing I have
done to offend you is, that I endeavor to refrain
from doing work on the seventh day, and to
"teach men so." Yet for this I am declared to be
the "least in the kingdom of heaven," and no longer
worthy of a seat at the table of Him who said, that
"one jot or one tittle" should <i>in no wise</i> pass from
the law.</p>

<p>Blessed be God! it is a light thing to be judged
of man's judgment. But I confess that sometimes
my blood runs cold, when I think of this solemn
declaration of the same "Lord of the Sabbath,"
(John 12:48,) "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth
not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the
word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him
in the last day." "Never man spake like this man."
O, brethren, are you ready for that awful judgment
day? Nothing but God's <i>word</i> will avail you there.
If you are determined to go on, appropriating the
seventh day to secular purposes, and "teaching men
so," I cannot help it; but I call heaven and earth
to witness, that, in regard to every reader of these
pages, my skirts are henceforth clear. On your
own souls will rest the responsibility of rejecting
these solemn words of Christ. And you who are
ministers&mdash;how will you answer for the wanderings
of those lambs of Christ's fold, whom you are leading
into strange pastures?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-41}</span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="small"><i>Fourth Reason.</i></span></h4>

<p>My fourth reason for believing this proposition is,
That God has never blessed and sanctified any day
of the week but the seventh.</p>

<p>In sustaining this reason, as I occupy negative
ground, I shall simply defend it against your usual
scripture arguments in defense of your favorite doctrine,
that God blessed and sanctified the first day of
the week, in commemoration of the resurrection of
Christ.</p>

<p>In arguing this doctrine, you do not pretend to
offer <i>positive</i>, but only <i>inferential</i> proof. You quote
certain texts, and say, Hence we infer that the first
day of the week is the Sabbath. Now, as there are
many possible, and even plausible, inferences, that
are not necessarily true, I intend to be governed,
in the examination of your scripture proofs, by the
following rule of interpretation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole counsel of God, concerning all things
necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith,
and life, is either expressly set down in scripture, or
<i>by good and necessary consequence</i> may be deduced
from scripture."</p>

<p>Brethren, I intend, with God's help, to show
that, according to the above rule, which you admit
to be correct, all your inferences in favor of a first-day
Sabbath are <i>unnecessary</i>, and some of them
wholly inadmissible.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR FIRST PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">Hebrews 4:9, 10&mdash;"There remaineth, therefore, a rest (sabbatism) to
 the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath
 ceased from his own works, as God did from his."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-42}</span>
Your premises consist of four assertions:&mdash;First,
That the rest, or sabbatism, that remaineth, is something
different from the ancient Sabbath. Second,
That the person who "hath ceased from his own
works, as God did from his," is the Lord Jesus
Christ. These two assertions I most cheerfully
admit. Third, That Christ entered into his rest on
the day of his resurrection. Fourth, That the sabbatism
of God's people is enjoyed in this life. These
last two assertions I utterly deny.</p>

<p>Your inference is, That the first day of every
week, that being the day of the week on which
Christ rose, is the sabbatism of God's people. Of
course, if I prove that the last two assertions are
false, your inference will be shown to be inadmissible.</p>

<p>I assert, then,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That Christ did <i>not</i> "enter into his rest" on
the day of his resurrection; for the following reasons:&mdash;First,
Because the Scriptures do not say so.
Second, Because this earth is not the place of his
rest. He was, to the last day he spent here, "a
pilgrim and a stranger in the earth," and had not
therein "where to lay his head." But his resurrection
took place on earth, and he continued on earth
for "forty days" afterwards. Third, Because the
scriptures plainly teach, that the Mediator <i>did</i> "enter
into his rest," when he "sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high." Heb. 1:3. "Arise,
O Lord, into thy rest; thou and the ark of thy
strength." Ps. 132:2. This was the prayer of
David and the congregation of Israel, when they removed
the ark from the house of Obed-Edom to the
place "that David had pitched for it." When Solomon
and the Elders of Israel brought up the ark
from the city of David, and placed it in the holy of
holies, in the temple "made with hands," they prayed
<span class="pagenum">{17-43}</span>
in like manner, "Now therefore arise, O Lord
God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy
strength." 2&nbsp;Chron. 6:41. Now the ark was a
type of Christ, while "heaven itself" is the true
"holy of holies," "whither the forerunner is for us
entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after
the order of Melchizedek." Heb. 6:20. If,
then, the ark entered into its rest, when it was
placed in the holy of holies, Jesus Christ, the anti-typical
ark, entered into <i>his</i> rest when he sat down
on the right hand of God, in the anti-typical holy of
holies. Fourth, Because the Apostle's great design,
in this epistle, was to convince the church, and especially
the Hebrews, that Christ, having "by himself
purged our sins," as they all admitted he had
done, "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
on high," (ch. 1:3,) as our ever-living Intercessor.
Yes, the "one idea," that runs through the whole
Epistle, is to illustrate and magnify the doctrine of
the glorious intercession of Christ the Mediator,
who, "after he had offered one sacrifice for sins,
forever sat down on the right hand of God." Do
you ask proof? Take, then, the apostle's own assertion,
(ch. 8:1,) "Now, of the things which we
have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high
priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of
the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary,
and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
pitched, and not man." All that is said in the third
and fourth chapters, about the rest of Christ and the
sabbatism of the people of God, is included in this
summary; so that it is to Christ's eternal rest in the
heavens that the verses under consideration refer.
Indeed, we have evidence of this fact, satisfactory
enough, in the immediate context, (ch. 3:4,)
"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly
calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest
<span class="pagenum">{17-44}</span>
of our profession, Christ Jesus"&mdash;compared with
ch. 4:14&mdash;"Seeing, then, that we have a great High
Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son
of God, let us hold fast our profession." Fifth, Because
there is not, in this epistle, one solitary reference
to the resurrection of Christ, except in the concluding
benediction; but it abounds in references
to his ascension and intercession.</p>

<p>2. If I have reasoned correctly above, your assertion,
that the sabbatism of God's people is enjoyed
in this life, scarcely needs refutation. As
Christ entered into his rest, when he received the
crown of glory from the Father; so believers shall
enter into his rest, when they "shall be glorified with
him." Moreover, as Christ did not enter into his
rest on the first day of the week, your inference,
that that day is the Sabbath, is not only <i>unnecessary</i>,
but wholly inadmissible.</p>

<p>Bear in mind also, brethren, that, if Christ did not
enter into his rest on the first day of the week, then
your great philosophical argument for the first-day
Sabbath, founded upon the fact, that the work of
redemption is greater than that of creation, vanishes
at once into smoke, or, at least, becomes useless for
your purpose.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR SECOND PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">Psalm 118:22, 24&mdash;"The stone which the builders refused is become the
 head-stone of the corner." "This is the day which the Lord hath made,
 we will rejoice and be glad in it."</p>

 <p class="small">Acts 4:10, 11&mdash;"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of
 Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye
 crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man
 stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at
 nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."</p>

<p>You premise, that "the day which the Lord hath
made" is the day of the resurrection of Christ.
<span class="pagenum">{17-45}</span>
Whence you infer, that the first day of the week is
the Sabbath.</p>

<p>1. If what you premise were true, the inference
does not follow. The prophet does not say, We
will rejoice and be glad in the same day of every
week; but, We will rejoice and be glad <i>in it</i>, that
is, in that day, whatever it may be. Now Christ
did not rise on the first day of every week, but on
one single day; and we may very well rejoice and
be glad in that one day, without keeping any Sabbath
in connection with it. Abraham rejoiced and
was glad in the day of Christ; but he kept no Sabbath
in honor of it. So, doubtless, <i>you</i> rejoice and
are glad in the day of his crucifixion, though you do
not celebrate it on any particular day of the week.
But&mdash;</p>

<p>2. You are evidently mistaken in referring this
language of the Psalmist to the resurrection of
Christ&mdash;for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;Because "the day which the Lord hath
made" is the same in which Christ went in by the
gates of righteousness. Verses 19 and 20. "Open
to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into
them, and I will praise the Lord. This gate of the
Lord, into which the righteous shall enter." Now,
though Christ <i>did</i> come up from "the gates of death"
on the day of his resurrection, he <i>did not</i> formally
"enter" by "the gates of righteousness," till that
day when he ascended from Mount Olivet, which
was not the first day of the week. His almighty
power and eternal Sonship were declared most gloriously
on the day of his resurrection; but it was
on the day of his ascension that his mediatorial
righteousness was formally approved by the Father;
while it was visibly manifested, in the presence of
the universe, that the door of heaven had been opened
to all true believers. Then shouted the seraphim,
<span class="pagenum">{17-46}</span>
and all the host of heaven, while the door-posts of
the New Jerusalem trembled at the voice, "Arise,
O Jehovah, into thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy
strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
and let thy saints shout for joy!" Therefore,
this is not the day of Christ's resurrection, but that
of his ascension.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Because "the day which the Lord hath
made" is the same in which "the stone which the
builders refused" became "the head-stone of the
corner," (verse 22.) Christ did not become "the
head of the corner," till he "sat down on the right
hand of God." You assert that he did, and refer to
Acts 4:10, 11, quoted above, as proof. From what
the apostle there sets forth, you draw the inference,
that, as he was set at nought by the builders, when
he was crucified, so he became the head of the corner,
when God raised him from the dead. The
apostle does not say, however, that this took place
on the same day that he rose from the dead; and all
that we must <i>necessarily</i> infer from what he <i>does say</i>,
is, that he became the head of the corner since his
resurrection, which is cheerfully admitted. But
whether it was on the same day, or two, or ten, or
forty days after, the apostle saith not. Still your inference
would be entirely natural and proper, if it
were not contrary to the analogy of faith, and to the
teachings of the same spirit in other parts of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>I suppose it will be admitted, that when Christ
became the head of the corner, he became "the
head over all things to the church," and that then
"all things were put under his feet." Now the
apostle clearly teaches, that these things took place
when he sat down on the right hand of God, as appears
from the following texts:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="small">Ephesians 1:20-22&mdash;"Which he wrought in Christ, when
 <span class="pagenum">{17-47}</span>
 he raised him from the dead, (or, having raised him from the dead,)
 and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above
 all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name
 that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to
 come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head
 over all things to the church."</p>

 <p class="small">Hebrews 2:8, 9&mdash;"But now we see not yet all things put under him
 (man;) but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,
 for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor." Observe,
 that the Apostle's great object in this epistle is, to show that
 Christ is <i>in heaven</i>, forever interceding for the church.</p>

<p>Now, is it not manifest from these texts, that Christ
became the head of the corner when he ascended
to his Father and our Father, to his God and our
God? Nor is there any thing in Acts 4:10, 11,
that contradicts this idea.</p>

<p>Brethren, the glorious building of grace has its
foundation, not on earth, where we are pilgrims and
strangers, but in heaven, where Jesus, the corner-stone,
"elect and precious," sitteth at the right hand
of God, and is constantly occupied in gathering from
afar the "lively stones" of the glorious edifice.
Blessed forever be his holy name!</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR THIRD PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">John 20:19, 26&mdash;"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of
 the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
 for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith
 unto them, Peace be unto you." "And after eight days again his
 disciples were within, and Thomas with them; then came Jesus; the
 doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto
 you."&mdash;See also Luke 24:26.</p>

<p>You premise, that the disciples, on the two days
referred to above, one of which certainly was, and
the other may have been, the first day of the week,
had met together for public or social worship, when
<span class="pagenum">{17-48}</span>
Christ appeared to them. Whence you infer, that
the first day of the week is the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Now, what you premise <i>seems</i> to be a mere assumption,
for which there is not a shadow of proof,
either in the text or context. No one of the Evangelists
says that they met for worship; nor did they
worship, so far as we know, when met together. In
regard to the first of those occasions, we are told,
that they "were assembled for fear of the Jews;"
and, as to the second, we are simply informed, that
they "were within," which means, probably, that
they were <i>at home</i>; for Luke tells us, that, on the
day of the ascension, the eleven "abode" in an upper
room. Acts 1:13.</p>

<p>Again, your inference is not <i>necessary</i>; for the
matter may be explained thus: On the day of the
resurrection, the eleven, having procured a common
lodging-room, "assembled for fear of the Jews;"
and Christ appeared to them before the close of the
same day, in order that they, who were to be witnesses
of his resurrection, might have ocular demonstration
of the fact, that he rose "according to the
scriptures." On the other occasion, "after eight
days," he met them, probably, "as they sat at meat,"
(Mark 16:14,) because Thomas, who had not seen
him since his resurrection, was then with them.</p>

<p>These reasons are surely sufficient to account for
his appearing on those occasions. But why demand
reasons at all? Had he not a right to meet his disciples
on any day of the week that he chose, without
telling us why? Can you tell us why he appeared
to the brethren when they were fishing?
Christ has done many things for which the only reason
we can give is, that it seemed good to him.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR FOURTH PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">Acts 2:1&mdash;"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
 all with one accord in one place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{17-49}</span>
Your premises are&mdash;1. That the Feast of Pentecost
fell that year on the first day of the week. 2.
That the disciples were, <i>for that reason</i>, with one accord
in one place. Whence you infer, that the
first day of the week is the Sabbath. I reply&mdash;</p>

<p>Whether the Feast of Pentecost fell that year on
the first day of the week, or not, the disciples did
not meet to keep the Sabbath, but to celebrate Pentecost.
They would have been, in like manner
"with one accord in one place," if it had been the
fourth day of the week, because it was the day of
Pentecost. Therefore, your inference is not only
<i>unnecessary</i>, but wholly inadmissible.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR FIFTH PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">Acts 20:7&mdash;"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples
 came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to
 depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."</p>

<p>You premise, that the disciples came together, in
this instance, to celebrate the Lord's Supper, and
to hear the word. Whence you infer, that the first
day of the week is the Sabbath.</p>

<p>What you premise is very uncertain; for&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There is no evidence that they met to hear the
word. The object of the meeting was "to break
bread;" and the preaching of Paul seems to have
been <i>incidental</i>, and not by appointment.</p>

<p>2. It is not certain that "to break bread" means
to partake of the Lord's Supper. The Greek word,
translated, <i>to break</i>, is used very often in the New
Testament in reference to ordinary meals. An instance
occurs in Luke 24:35&mdash;"And they told
what things were done in the way, and how he was
known of them <i>in breaking of bread</i>."</p>

<p>But if what you assert were true, your inference
is not <i>necessary</i>; for&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It is entirely proper, for aught we know to the
<span class="pagenum">{17-50}</span>
contrary, to celebrate the Lord's Supper and hear
preaching on any day of the week.</p>

<p>2. Perhaps this meeting was held at that particular
time, because the Apostle and his company were
"ready to depart on the morrow." It was probably
a farewell meeting, as many learned men think,
and the text itself <i>seems</i> to hint.</p>

<p>3. There is not one word said in the text about
Sabbath-keeping; nor is there the least intimation,
either in the text or context, that the disciples were
<i>accustomed</i> to meet on the first day of the week for
any purpose whatever.</p>

<p>But you say, Paul waited there seven days, and
we have no account of his preaching till the last
night of his stay, which was the first of the week.
We reply, This is no evidence that he did not preach
during the other six days. Luke tells us, in this
same chapter, verses 2 and 3, that "he came into
Greece, and there abode three months;" and he
does not say that he preached once during that time.
But a small part, indeed, of the doings of the Apostles
is recorded.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that this text, which is the
only one in the New Testament that speaks of public
religious exercises on the first day of the week,
is, at the same time, the only one in the Bible that
directly proves, that this day is <i>not</i> the Sabbath. I
have already proposed to give up the argument in
favor of the seventh day, if you produce one apostolic
example of unnecessary labor performed therein.
Will you give up your argument for the first
day on the same condition? I believe this verse
furnishes such an example.</p>

<p>The text proves nothing for you, if Paul's sermon
and the breaking of bread were not on the first day.
The sermon was preached between evening and
<span class="pagenum">{17-51}</span>
midnight, and the bread was broken between midnight
and break of day, and then Paul set out on
his journey. According to the Roman method of
computing time, the breaking of bread, at least, was
in the morning of the same day in which Paul traveled
from Troas to Assos, and thence to Mitylene;
and, according to the Jewish method, the sermon, the
breaking of bread, and the journey from Troas to
Mitylene, were all within the compass of the same
"first day of the week." That Luke should follow
the unnatural Roman method, is so unlikely as hardly
to be supposable. Now, if Paul traveled unnecessarily
from Troas to Mitylene, as it seems he did,
on the first day of the week, surely that day was not
then the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. This
text, therefore, <i>proves positively that the first day is
not the Sabbath</i>, on which account it is of no little
value in this controversy.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR SIXTH PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:2&mdash;"Upon the first day of the week, let every one of
 you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
 gatherings when I come."</p>

<p>Your premises are&mdash;1. That the Apostle here commands
the Corinthians to make public collections
on the first day of the week. 2. That, therefore,
public assemblies were accustomed to be held on
that day. Whence you infer, that the first day of
the week is the Sabbath.</p>

<p>I deny both your premises. The apostle simply
orders, that each one of the Corinthian brethren
should lay up <i>at home</i> some portion of his weekly
gains on the first day of the week. The whole
question turns upon the meaning of the expression,
"by him;" and I marvel greatly how you can
imagine that it means "in the collection box of the
congregation." Greenfield, in his Lexicon, translates
<span class="pagenum">{17-52}</span>
the Greek term, "<i>by one's self, i. e. at home</i>."
Two Latin versions, the Vulgate and that of Castellio,
render it, "<i>apud se</i>," with one's self, at home.
Three French translations, those of Martin, Osterwald,
and De Sacy, "<i>chez soi</i>," at his own house,
at home. The German of Luther, "<i>bei sich selbst</i>,"
by himself, at home. The Dutch, "<i>by hemselven</i>,"
same as the German. The Italian of Diodati "<i>appresso
di se</i>," in his own presence, at home. The
Spanish of Felipe Scio, "<i>en su casa</i>," in his own
house. The Portuguese of Ferreira, "<i>para isso</i>,"
with himself. The Swedish, "<i>nær sig sielf</i>," near
himself. I know not how much this list of authorities
might be swelled, for I have not examined one
translation that differs from those quoted above.
Now, if your premises are false, your inference is
not only <i>unnecessary</i>, but wholly inadmissible.</p>

<h5 class="x-small">YOUR SEVENTH PROOF.</h5>

 <p class="small">Revelations 1:10&mdash;"I was in the spirit on the
 Lord's day."</p>

<p>You premise, that the "Lord's day" is the first
day of the week. Whence you infer, that the first
day of the week is the Sabbath.</p>

<p>You here assume the principal point in dispute,
namely, that God has appointed the first day of
every week to be kept in commemoration of the resurrection
of Christ. Is every Friday the "Lord's
day," because he was crucified on Friday? You
answer, No. Is every Thursday the "Lord's day,"
because he ascended on Thursday? You answer,
No. So, when you ask, Is every first day of the
week the "Lord's day," because he rose on the
first day? I answer, No. And is it too much that I
should ask you to prove your assumption? I have
never yet met with an attempt to prove it.</p>

<p>But, were this even proved, your inference would
not be <i>necessary</i>. The first day <i>might</i> be the "Lord's
<span class="pagenum">{17-53}</span>
day," and yet not the Sabbath. Would the bare
mention of this day by the Apostle John, even if it
were certain that he referred to the first day of the
week, repeal or alter the fourth commandment?
Certainly not. But you ask, What day did he mean?
I reply, Most probably he meant the seventh, since
we know from several scriptures that this <i>is in fact
the Lord's day</i>. See Nehemiah 9:14, and Isaiah
58:13. But you ask again, Why did he not say
"the Sabbath," if he meant it? I reply by asking
you, Why did he not say "the first day," if he meant
it?</p>

<p>Brethren, who can say, that, from any or all of
the texts commented upon above, the inference is
<i>necessary</i>, that the first day of the week <i>is</i>, and that
the seventh <i>is not</i>, <i>holy</i>? But this is precisely what
<i>you</i> infer from them. On the sole authority of these
passages, together with that one in which Christ
says, that he is "Lord of the Sabbath," you have no
hesitation in affirming that the first day of the week
is the very Sabbath day spoken of in the fourth commandment,
and that the seventh day of the week is
not <i>now</i> more holy than any other; or, in other
words, that the blessing which God put upon it in
the beginning, (Gen. 2:21,) has been taken from
it, and given to another day. What! because
"there remaineth a sabbatism to the people of God,"
therefore the seventh day <i>must</i> have ceased to be
the Sabbath! Because "we will be glad and rejoice"
in "the day which the Lord hath made,"
therefore the seventh day <i>must</i> have ceased to be
holy! Because Christ showed himself to his disciples
once or twice on the first day of the week,
therefore the seventh day <i>cannot</i> be the Sabbath!
Because the Pentecostal effusion of the Holy Ghost
happened on the first day of the week, as is clearly
demonstrated by arithmetical calculation, therefore
<span class="pagenum">{17-54}</span>
the seventh day <i>cannot</i> claim to be the Sabbath!
Because the disciples met <i>once</i> "to break bread" on
the first day of the week, therefore God <i>must</i> have
unsanctified the seventh day! Because the Corinthian
and Galatian Christians were commanded to
"lay by them in store" on the first day of the week,
for the relief of the poor saints, therefore the seventh
day <i>can be nothing more</i> than a working day!
Because John was "in the spirit on the Lord's day,"
therefore the seventh day <i>cannot</i> be "the Lord's
day," as it used to be! Because Jesus Christ is
"Lord of the Sabbath," and has the right to change
it, or even to annihilate it, (?) therefore the seventh
day <i>must</i> have ceased to be a day of rest! O brethren,
you dare not say, that any of these inferences
flow from the Scriptures as <i>necessary consequences</i>.
But if they are not <i>necessary</i>&mdash;if there is any way
of avoiding them, without doing violence either to
the text or context&mdash;how <i>can</i> you ask me to believe
that the first day <i>is</i>, and that the seventh <i>is not</i>, holy?</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p>"The Sabbath was made for man." I am a man;
therefore, the Sabbath was made for me. God has
blessed and sanctified <i>the seventh day</i> of the week,
and commanded me to keep it holy <i>for that reason</i>;
therefore, as long as the seventh day continues to
be divinely blessed and sanctified, I am bound to
keep it holy. But it is nowhere said in the Bible
that God has removed the blessing from this day, or
that he has unsanctified it. <i>You</i> say so, indeed; but
you are neither the authors nor the finishers of my
<span class="pagenum">{17-55}</span>
faith; nor will your unsupported assertion, a thousand
times repeated, amount to a divine revelation.
If you assert that it is the will of God that I should
cease to regard the seventh day as holy, I ask,
Where is this revealed? What Prophet or Apostle
has said so, <i>directly or indirectly</i>? It is not
enough for you to answer, that the first day has been
blessed and sanctified, as a memorial of the work of
redemption. That assertion, if it were true, would
not prove that the seventh day <i>is not holy</i>. No,
brethren, your own conscience must tell you, that
there is not one syllable in the Bible on which to
ground the doctrine that God has <i>unsanctified</i> the
seventh day of the week.</p>

<p>But one of your ministers has told me, that God
did not bless and sanctify any particular day of the
week, but only the Sabbath Institution. To this I
have only to say, "Let God be true, and every man
a liar." The Holy Ghost says, (Gen. 2:2,) "And
God blessed the <i>seventh day</i>, and sanctified it;" and
again, (Exod. 20:11,) "Wherefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath <span class="smcap">day</span>, and hallowed it." Now, if you
assert, with these scriptures staring you in the face,
that God never blessed and sanctified any particular
day, but only the Sabbath Institution, do you
not make God a liar, in order to excuse your own
rebellion? O brethren, I perceive that these texts
are an eye-sore to you, and that in your hearts you
wish they were out of the Bible. If you loved
them you would not flatly contradict them. I appeal
to your own consciousness, is it not your great
effort, when you take up the fourth commandment,
to convince yourselves and others, that God's Spirit
<i>does not mean</i> what he says, in as plain language as
any Sabbatarian could employ; that is, that 'the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.' And,
when you take up these passages in the New Testament,
<span class="pagenum">{17-56}</span>
which have been considered above, do you
not labor to convince yourselves, that the same
Spirit <i>does mean</i> what he <i>does not say</i>; that is, that
the first day is the Sabbath?</p>

<p>You do not believe that what God says a dozen
times, or more, <i>can</i> be true; but you are sure, that
what he <i>does not say even once</i> is infallibly true; and
that nothing but stupidity or scepticism would presume
to doubt it. When you are told that the seventh
day is the Sabbath, and the testimony of God's
Spirit, plainly uttered in one dozen passages, together
with the uniform practice of the church as
long as we can trace the inspired history of the Sabbath,
is offered in proof of the assertion, you shut
your eyes, and declare that you can see nothing,
and that all this proves nothing. But when you tell
me, that the first day <i>is</i>, and that the seventh <i>is not</i>,
the Sabbath, and quote, as proof, Acts 20:7, and a
few other passages, not one of which says one word
about the Sabbath, or the seventh day, or a day of
rest, or holy time, or exercises which are proper
only on the Sabbath, you affirm, that you have proved
your position beyond all doubt, and that the only
reason why I cannot see the evidence is because
the vail of Judaism is over my eyes. The moral
law says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath;" but
you say, "No, the seventh day is not the Sabbath;
you do not understand the law; you mistake its
meaning." Neither that law, nor any other in the
Bible, says, "The first day is the Sabbath." Notwithstanding,
you dare to lift up your hands, and
swear by the living God, that the first day <i>is</i> the
Sabbath. But this is not all. Oh! that it were!
The Holy Ghost has said, not only in the record
that God made on Adam's heart, and in the covenant
of works, but also in the written law given at
Mount Sinai, and in several other passages of Scripture,
<span class="pagenum">{17-57}</span>
"The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God." But you have repeatedly sworn by the
infinite, eternal, and unchangeable Jehovah, that
<i>this assertion is not true</i>&mdash;that the seventh day is
<i>not</i> the Sabbath of the Lord our God&mdash;that it is a
common working day. Because I can no longer
join you in this heaven-daring oath, you have declared
me unworthy of the confidence of a Christian
people, and forbidden me to perform any longer the
functions of a missionary of the cross. You have
told the church, that, having violated my ordination
vows, I have forfeited my ministry, and that my seat at
the Lord's table is vacant. You have thus flung
upon the heedless winds the mad-dog cry of "suspended
minister," "covenant-breaker," and "disturber
of the church's peace."</p>

<p>But think not, brethren, beloved in the Lord, that
the treatment which I have received at your hands
shall deter me from proclaiming what I believe to
be God's truth, as God may give me utterance.
That you wish to do what is right, I do not doubt.
That you believe you do God service in thrusting
me from your Christian embraces, is evident enough.
That many of you love me yet, and pray for me, I
can but hope. But that you all sin in not searching
the Scriptures daily to see whether these things
are so, I do firmly believe.</p>

<p>And now, brethren, I cannot close this treatise
without uttering a word of warning to every one of
you, which will, I fear, be very generally disregarded
by you. Yet "wo is me" if I utter it not! Do
not, I beseech you, be angry at any thing I have
written, or refuse to hear my parting words because
I am a "suspended minister." You have loaded
me with reproach, not because I have committed
any crime, but because I have plead for the integrity
<span class="pagenum">{17-58}</span>
and immutability of the moral law. I am neither
a thief, nor a murderer, nor a robber of churches,
but I do most firmly believe, that the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord my God, and that you,
and all others who do not keep it holy, are guilty
before God of a gross violation of the moral law.
And can I, under those circumstances, regard your
reproaches as a legitimate expression of the Divine
displeasure? No. That I am really unworthy of
the gospel ministry, I confess. That I am not sufficient
for these things, I know. But, after having
been regularly called to this responsible work, I
will not be driven from it, for such a cause. Know
then, ye rulers in the house of God, that I am still a
minister of Jesus Christ, sent forth to proclaim the
terrors of God's law to the rebellious and impenitent,
and to promise the grace of the gospel to the penitent
and believing. Know also, ye professors of
the Christian religion who neglect the sanctification
of the seventh day, and especially ye ministers
of Jesus who "teach men so," that you make dark
what God has made plain; that you pluck out of the
hand of God's schoolmaster one of those rods wherewith
he would lash the carnal heart; that you hide
one of God's candles under a bushel, and compass
yourselves about with sparks, and a fire of your
own kindling; that you provoke the Holy Spirit, in
rejecting his testimony, and teaching for doctrine
the commandments of men. Yes, brethren, though
my words fall upon your ears as an idle tale that
you believe not, I declare to you, in the name of
Him whom your doctrine dishonors and your philosophy
insults&mdash;in the name of that <i>suspended
Minister</i>, to whom all the ends of the earth shall
look for salvation&mdash;that, if you repent not, the Holy
Ghost will bear witness against you, in the awful
day of retribution, that you have refused his words,
<span class="pagenum">{17-59}</span>
and that you have "put darkness for light, and light
for darkness!"</p>

<p>Think not that I am your enemy, because I thus
speak. Think not that I have no confidence in your
piety, because I rebuke you sharply. Think not
that I am proud, boastful, and self-confident, because
I dare to approach <i>you</i>, who are vastly my superiors
in knowledge, and remind you of your duty. I
would gladly have avoided this public exhibition of
my sentiments. Had it been possible to withhold
my testimony, you would never have seen these
pages. But "necessity is laid upon me." And
think not, I beseech you, that I am against the
church of our Redeemer, or would hinder her prosperity,
because I oppose a human institution which
Christians very generally observe. "If I forget
thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem
above my chief joy."</p>

I believe, that the prophecy in Dan. 7:25, refers mainly to
the change of Sabbath-time, and Sabbath-law. What time, of
divine appointment, it may be asked, was ever changed, except
the time of the Sabbath?</p>

Some of my Reformed Presbyterian brethren appear to be
as far from believing "the whole doctrine of the Westminster
Confession of Faith" as myself, only they are a little more
guarded in the choice of words. That Confession says, (ch.
21, sec. 7,)"&mdash;so, in his word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual
commandment, <i>binding all men in all ages</i>, he hath particularly
appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath, to be kept
holy unto him." But Rev. Andrew Stephenson, in a letter to
me, speaking of the seventh-day Sabbath, styles it, "This relict
of Judaism;" and Rev. James Milligan, in a recent letter,
asks me, "Why has not the Lord's day as good a right to take
the place of the seventh day, as the Lord's Supper has to
take the place of the Passover?" Query&mdash;Are Reformed Presbyterians,
who hold such sentiments, any better qualified to
judge their brethren for Sabbath-breaking, than I would be to
judge them for a like offense?</p>
